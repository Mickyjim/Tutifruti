          Acai berry is a small, round, deep purple fruit obtained from the acai palm tree. Botanically, acai belongs to palm or Arecaceae family of tall trees in the genus Euterpe, and botanically known as Euterpe oleracea.

          Acai palm is a tall, slender tree growing to a height of 15 to 25 m. An average mature plant may possess 3-10 well-developed stems of 10-18 cm each in diameter from a single root system. It grows better under waterlogged low-lying plains receiving good annual rainfall. Each stem behaves like an individual tree and bears 3-5 bunches with each carrying hundreds of berries much similar to areca or date palm.

          Each acai berry measures about the size of a small sized grape, 2-3 cm in diameter. Immature fruits appear dark-green initially, which turn deep-purple upon attaining maturity. Technically, the fruit is a "drupe" which consists of outer-edible pulp (mesocarp) surrounding a large seed (stone). Only this part (mesocarp), comprising only about 10-15% of the berry weight, is edible.
          
          Health benefits of acai berry

          Acai-berry has superb levels of anti-oxidants, minerals, and vitamins that have health benefiting and disease preventing properties.

          Unlike other berries and fruits, Acai has high caloric values and fats. 100 grams of carry about 80-250 calories depending upon the preparation and serving methods. In fact, fresh acai berry has been the staple nutritious diet of native Amazonian for centuries.

          Acai berry contains many polyphenolic anthocyanin compounds like resveratrol, cyanidin-3-galactoside, ferulic acid, delphinidin, petunidin as well as astringent pro-anthocyanidin tannins like epicatechin, protocatechuic acid, and ellagic acid. Scientific studies suggest that these compounds have been claimed to act as anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer functions by their free radical fighting actions. Besides, tannins found to have anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, and anti-hemorrhagic properties.

          Primary research studies suggest that ellagic acid in acai has anti-proliferative properties by its ability to directly inhibit DNA binding of certain carcinogens (nitrosamine toxins) in the food.

          Acai berry is also rich in medium chain fatty acids like oleic acid (omega-9) and linoleic acid (omega-6). These compounds help reduce the LDL-cholesterol level and raise good HDL-cholesterol concentrations in the body and thus help cut down heart disease risk. Additionally, the essential fats in acai contribute to maintaining adequate moisture in the skin and prevent skin dryness.

          Acai pulp has good levels of dietary fiber. Adequate fiber in the diet helps clear excess cholesterol through the bowel movements.

          ORAC value (oxygen radical absorbance capacity) of acai berry is thought to be at the mid-level range for fruits, higher than that of oranges but less than pomegranate. USDA, however, has not validated the exact ORAC value for acai so far.

          Acai berries contain a good amount of minerals like potassium, manganese, copper, iron, and magnesium. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids that helps controlling heart rate and blood pressure. The human body utilizes Manganese as a co-factor for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase.

          Further, they are rich in B-complex vitamins and vitamin-K. Niacin, vitamin B-6 (pyridoxine) and riboflavin found in adequate amounts in them. These vitamins function as co-factors and help the body in the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.

          Acai uses in traditional medicine

          Acai berry extraction being employed by Amazon natives as a treatment remedy for diarrhea, parasitic infections, hemorrhages, and ulcer treatment.

          A kind of decoction obtained from crushed acai seeds has been in use for the treatment of fever.

          in the Peruvian culture, decoction derived from the acai roots has been found useful in the treatment of menstrual pain, liver diseases, malaria.

Certain antioxidants in apples have health promoting and disease prevention properties, and thereby, truly justifying the adage, “an apple a day keeps the doctor away.”

          Apples are obtained from medium-sized tree belonging to the Rosaceae family. The apple tree is thought to have originated in nutrient-rich mountain ranges of Kazakhstan. Today, its cultivation fostered in many parts of the world including the USA as a major commercial crop.

          Apple fruit features oval or pear shape. Its outer peel appears in different hues and colors depending upon the cultivar type. Internally, it's crispy, juicy pulp is off-white to cream in color, and has a mix of mildly sweet and tart flavor. Its seeds are bitter in taste, and therefore, inedible.

          Hundreds of varieties of apples that meant to be used either as table fruits or dessert and cooking varieties are grown in the US and worldwide. Cooking apples tend to be larger in size, crispier, and tarter than dessert types.
          
          Health benefits of apple

              Delicious and crunchy apple fruit is notable for its impressive list of phtytonutrients, and antioxidants. Studies suggest that its components are essential for optimal growth, development, and overall wellness.

              Apples are low in calories; 100 g of fresh fruit slices provide just 50 calories. They, however, contain no saturated fats or cholesterol. Nonetheless, the fruit is rich in dietary fiber, which helps prevent absorption of dietary-LDL or bad cholesterol in the gut. The fiber also saves the colon mucous membrane from exposure to toxic substances by binding to cancer-causing chemicals inside the colon.

              Apples are rich in antioxidant phytonutrients flavonoids and polyphenolics. The total measured antioxidant strength (ORAC value) of 100 g apple fruit is 5900 TE. Some of the important flavonoids in apples are quercetin, epicatechin, and procyanidin B2.

              Additionally, they are also good in tartaric acid that gives tart flavor to them. Altogether, these compounds help the body protect from harmful effects of free radicals.

              Apple fruit contains good quantities of vitamin-C and β-carotene. Vitamin C is a powerful natural antioxidant. Consumption of foods rich in vitamin-C helps the body develop resistance against infectious agents and scavenge harmful, pro-inflammatory free radicals from the body.

              Further, apple fruit is an ideal source of B-complex vitamins such as riboflavin, thiamin, and pyridoxine (vitamin B-6). Together, these vitamins help as co-factors for enzymes in metabolism as well as in various synthetic functions inside the human body.

              Apples also carry small quantities of minerals like potassium, phosphorus, and calcium. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids helps controlling heart rate and blood pressure; thus, counters the bad influences of sodium.

          Full of fragrance and sweet, golden-orange apricots are another summer delicacies of Asian origin. These much-prized fruits were first brought to Europe by Greeks, who named them as “golden eggs of the sun."

          Botanically, the fruit is closely related to peaches and nectarine; sharing with them in the broader Rosaceae family of fruit-trees in the genus; Prunus.

          Today, some of the main producing regions of this fruit are Turkey, Iran, Italy, France, Spain, Syria, Greece, and China.

          Apricot is a medium-sized deciduous tree that grows best in well-drained mountain slope soils. During the spring, it bears plenty of beautiful pinkish-white flowers that attract bees.

          The fruits have almost uniform size, 4-5 cm in diameter, and weigh about 35 g. In structure; apricot is a drupe, consisting of a centrally located single pit surrounded by crunchy, aromatic edible flesh. The seed enclosed in a hard stony shell often called as "stone."

          Fresh, ripe apricots have a sweet flavor similar to plums. Sundried organic apricots are nutritiously denser than fresh ones, although they have less in vitamin-C content. Its seed-kernel is also edible and taste like that of almond nut. Oil extracted from these kernels employed in cooking.

          Health benefits of apricots

              Fresh fruits are low in calories, composing just 48 calories per 100 g weight. Nonetheless, they are an excellent source of dietary fiber, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals.

              Apricots are good source of numerous health promoting phytochemicals that help prevent heart disease, reduce LDL, ("bad cholesterol") levels and offer protection against cancers.

              Apricots are excellent sources of vitamin-A and carotenes. 100 grams of fresh fruits carry 1926 IU or 64% of daily required levels of vitamin-A. These compounds known to have antioxidant properties and are essential for vision.

              Vitamin-A also required for maintaining healthy mucosa and skin. Consumption of natural fruits rich in carotenes helps protect the body from lung and oral cavity cancers.

              Fresh fruits contain vitamin-C, another natural antioxidant. Vitamin-C helps the human body develop resistance against infectious agents and scavenge harmful oxygen-free radicals.

              They are an also good source of minerals such as potassium, iron, zinc, calcium and manganese. Potassium is a heart-healthy mineral; an important component of cell and body fluids that help regulate heart rate and blood pressure.

              The total antioxidant or ORAC value of fresh apricots is 1115 μmol TE/100 g. Most of this value attributed to some important health promoting flavonoid poly phenolic antioxidants such as lutein, zeaxanthin, and beta-cryptoxanthin. Altogether, these compounds act as protective scavengers against oxygen-derived free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that play a role in aging, cancers and various disease process.

              Further, zeaxanthin, a carotenoid selectively concentrated in the retinal "macula lutea" in the human eyes where it is thought to provide antioxidant and protective UV light-filtering functions. Thus, consumption of fruits rich in zeaxanthin helps eyes protect from age-related macular disease (AMRD), especially in the older adults.

        Avocados are characteristically buttery yet subtly flavorful pear-shaped fruits of Central American origin. Unlike most other fruits, they feature high-fat content and carry more calories. Nonetheless, they are among the popular fruits having good nutrition profile and health benefiting properties.

        Botanically, the fruit belongs to the family of Lauraceae, the family that also includes some special members like bay laurel, cinnamon, etc.

        Some of the common names are alligator pear, aguacate, butter pear, etc.

        Avocado is a medium-sized, evergreen tree that reaches about 20-30 feet in height, and feature large, green foliage cover. It prefers fertile soil with high moisture to flourish. Small light green flowers appear during winter. In about 8-10 months time from bloom, hundreds of pear-shaped green fruits cover all over the tree.

        Avocados mature on the tree but ripen only after their harvest. Once Ripen, their complexion turns from light green to deep green or purple, and yield to gentle thumb pressure. Inside, its creamy flesh has a buttery texture with bland taste yet pleasant aroma. The fruit features centrally placed single brown color seed. On an average, each fruit weighs about 300-700 g, although the sight of heavier avocados is not rare in the markets.

        Health benefits of avocado

            Avocados, like olives, are high in mono-unsaturated fats and calories. However, they are very rich in dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals and packed with numerous health benefiting plant nutrients.

            Its creamy pulp is an excellent source of mono-unsaturated fatty acids like oleic and palmitoleic acids as well as omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, linoleic acid. Research studies suggest that the Mediterranean diet which is rich in mono-unsaturated fatty acids help lower LDL or bad cholesterol and increase HDL or good cholesterol, and thereby, help prevent coronary artery disease as well as stroke risk through favoring healthy blood lipid profile.

            They are an excellent source of soluble and insoluble dietary fiber. 100 grams of fruit provides 6.7 g or about 18% of recommended daily intake of fiber. Dietary fiber helps lower blood cholesterol levels and prevent constipation.

            Moreover, it composes high concentrations of tannin akin to persimmons. Tannin, a polyphenolic compound which once labeled as an antinutritional agent, in fact, has beneficial anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer, and antioxidant properties.

            The creamy flesh holds many health promoting flavonoid polyphenolic antioxidants such as cryptoxanthin, lutein, zea-xanthin, beta and alpha carotenes, albeit in small amounts. Together, these compounds work as protective scavengers against oxygen-derived free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that play a role in aging and various disease processes.

            Total antioxidant strength (ORAC) of avocados (raw, Hass variety) is 1933 µmol TE/100 g.

            They are also good in many health-benefiting vitamins. Vitamins A, E, and K primarily concentrated in its creamy pulp.

            Avocados are also excellent sources of minerals like iron, copper, magnesium, and manganese. Magnesium is essential for bone strengthening and has a cardiac-protective role as well. Manganese used by the human body as a co-factor for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase. Iron and copper required for the production of red blood cells.

            Fresh avocado pear is a very rich source of potassium. 100 g of fruit provides 485 mg or about 10% of required daily levels. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids where it helps regulate heart rate and blood pressure, countering harmful effects of sodium.

        Enjoy banana fruit; nature's energy-rich food that comes with a safety envelope! Fresh, creamy, and delicious dessert bananas are one of the cheapest and readily available fruits all year round.

        Botanically, it belongs to the family of Musaceae. Commercially, it is one of the widely cultivated crops in the tropical and subtropical zones. Scientific name: Musa acuminata colla.

        Banana is a perennial herbaceous plant that grows from the underground rhizome. It flourishes well under tropical, moisture-rich, humid, low-lying farmlands.

        Banana has unique growth characteristics. In fact, the whole plant is a false stem (pseudostem). This pseudostem is consisting of broad leaves, together with their long petioles, overlapping each other in a disc-like fashion. The whole plant may reach 2 to 6 meters in height from the ground surface depending upon the cultivar types. At maturity, the rhizome gives rise to a flower (inflorescence) which is carried up along actual (true) core stem (smooth un-branched stem) which pass through the center of the pseudostem. The flower finally emerges out at the top in-between leaf clusters. The inflorescence subsequently develops to a large hanging bunch, consisting of 3 to 20 hands (tiers of fruit), with each hand carrying at least 5-10 fingers (fruits).

        There exist several cultivars of banana that comes in a different size (4-9inches), color (yellow to brown), weight (70-150g) and taste. Cavendish is the most common cultivar type among bananas globally. Structurally, it has a protective outer skin layer enveloping around delicious, sweet and tart, cream white edible flesh.

        Plantains are other cultivar types; often recognized as cooking bananas. They are intimately related to natural fruit (dessert) bananas. Plantains employed as a staple food in many parts of tropical African and Caribbean regions as well as in Thailand, Laos, and other Southeast Asian parts.

        Health benefits of banana fruit

            Banana is one of a high caloried tropical fruits. 100 grams of its flesh carries 90 calories. Nonetheless, it packed with numerous health benefiting phytonutrients lke dietary fiber, anti-oxidants, minerals, and vitamins.

            Banana fruit is composed of soft, easily digestible flesh made up of simple sugars like fructose and sucrose that upon consumption instantly replenishes energy and revitalizes the body. Thus, for these qualities, it is one of the favorite quick bites among athletes to get instant energy. It is also one of the recommended supplement food included in the treatment plan for under-nourished children.

            The fruit holds a good amount of soluble dietary fiber (7% of DRA per 100 grams) that helps in regular bowel movements; thereby reducing constipation problems.

            It contains health promoting flavonoid poly-phenolic antioxidants such as lutein, zeaxanthin, alpha, and beta-carotenes; albeit, in small amounts. Together, these compounds help act as protective scavengers against oxygen-derived free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that play a role in aging and various disease processes.

            Banana is a good source of vitamin-B6 (pyridoxine); provides about 28% of daily-recommended allowance. Pyridoxine is an essential B-complex vitamin that has a beneficial role in the treatment of neuritis, and anemia. Further, it helps decrease homocysteine (one of the triggering factors in coronary artery disease (CHD) and stroke episodes) levels within the human body.

            The fruit is also an ideal source of vitamin-C (about 8.7 mg per 100g). Consumption of foods rich in vitamin-C helps the body develop resistance against infectious agents and scavenge harmful oxygen-free radicals.

            Fresh bananas provide adequate levels of minerals like copper, magnesium, and manganese. Magnesium is essential for bone strengthening and has a cardiac-protective role as well. Manganese utilized as a co-factor for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase. Copper is an essential trace element in the production of red blood cells.

            Fresh banana is a very rich source of potassium. 100 g fruit provides 358 mg potassium. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids that helps control heart rate and blood pressure, countering harmful effects of sodium.

          Sweet, delicious prickly pear (cactus pear) are round to oval fruits obtained from the cactus plants. Although several hundred cultivar types of cactus grow in their natural habitat particularly in arid and dry lands, edible fruits usually gathered from commercially grown Opuntia ficus-indica species.

          Some of the common names are cactus fruit, barbary fig, tuna cactus, etc.

          Native inhabitants of Mexico and South-western USA understood the food and medicinal values of opuntia for very long time. Spanish explorers introduced them to Europe and North Africa. Today, cactus pears are gaining popularity in the rest of US and among Europeans.

          Cacti are evergreen, modified stem plants. They thought to have originated in the deserts of Mexico, where they readily grow under semi-arid and desert climates. Cactus leaves are actually flat, oval, and pad-like stems (nopales) gathered for edible pads and as animal fodder.

          During the spring, attractive blooms appear in red, white, or purple along the edge of pads (cladodes), which subsequently develop to pear shaped delicious fruits. Each fruit is a berry which measures about 5 cm in diameter and weigh about 100-150 grams. Their outer rind is marked by nodules containing fine spines (glochids).

          Inside, the fruit features pink, yellow or off-white flesh and tiny edible seeds interspersed all over the fruit as in pitahaya. The flavor described as juicy, fairly sweet, and pleasantly scented.

          Health benefits of prickly pear (opuntia)

              Prickly pears are closely related to another cactus produce, dragon fruit. Fresh cactus pear is low in energy, carrying just about 41 calories per 100 g. Nonetheless, it holds many health-benefting antioxidants, minerals, vitamins, and fiber.

              Its deep red, juicy pulp contains ample amounts of betalain (betacyanin and betaxanthin) pigment anti-oxidants. These substances help the human body fight against inflammation, cancers, and aging. These pigments are also found in beets, chard, amaranth leaves, and some mushrooms.

              Its flesh along contains a good amounts of dietary fiber. This roughage binds to cancer-causing toxins and chemicals in the colon and thereby protecting its mucosa from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), cancers, and diverticulitis. Also, it helps reduce fat absorption and blood LDL-cholesterol levels.

              The fruit is a modest source of antioxidant vitamin-C; providing about 14 mg per 100 g or about 24% of the DRI (daily-recommended intake). Consumption of foods rich in vitamin-C helps the body develop resistance to combat against infectious agents and scavenge harmful free radicals.

              Yellow and red flesh varieties contains small amunts of vitamin-A, and carotenes. Together; these compounds have been known to have antioxidant properties and are essential for vision. Vitamin-A also required for maintaining healthy mucosa and skin. Consumption of natural fruits rich in carotenes is known to protect from lung and oral cavity cancers.

              It also contains good amounts of minerals like calcium, manganese, iron, and magnesium. Manganese utilized inside the human body as a co-factor for the powerful antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase. Calcium and magnesium are important bone-strengthening minerals.

            Sweet, succulent blackberries are summer delicacies in the northern temperate regions. As in raspberries, they too grow on shrubs known as "brambles." The plant is native to sub-arctic Europe and nowadays grown at commercial scale in North America, particularly in the USA, to as far as Siberia.

            Binomially, brambles are small perennial shrubs belonging to the huge Rosaceae family of bush berries, in the Genus: Rubus.

            Depending upon cultivar type blackberry bush can be classified into erect, semi-erect, and trailing types. Erect type bush generally features cane thorns, and spreads by root suckers (which send cane shoots) along the hedgerows. Whereas, trailing shrubs require trellis to support growth, and spread through fresh shoots known as canes or primocanes. During the second year, these primocanes become floricanes. White or pink flowers appear in the floricanes.

            Technically, blackberry is an aggregate fruit consisting of small drupelets arranged in circular fashion. Each drupelet composes of juicy pulp with single tiny seed. Each berry measures about 3-4 cm in length containing about 80-100 drupelets.

            Loganberries and phenomenon-berries are hybrids between blackberry and red raspberry. Several other bramble berries such as boysenberry, ness berry, youngberry, marionberry, etc., are hybrids of dewberry, blackberry, and wild raspberry cultivars.
            
          Health benefits of blackberries

                As in other kinds of bush berries, blackberries too packed with many plant nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and dietary fibers that are essential for optimum health.

                The berries are very low in calories. 100 g provide just 43 calories. Nonetheless, they are rich in soluble and insoluble fiber (100 g whole berries consist of 5.3 g or 14% RDA of fiber). Xylitol is a low-calorie sugar substitute existing in the fiber content. It absorbed into the blood at a rate slower than glucose inside the gut. It, thus, helps in steadying blood sugar levels.

                Blackberries compose significantly high amounts of phenolic flavonoid phytochemicals such as anthocyanins, ellagic acid, tannin), quercetin, gallic acid, cyanidin, pelargonidin, catechins, kaempferol, and salicylic acid. Scientific studies suggest that these antioxidant compounds may have potential health benefits against cancer, aging, inflammation, and neurological diseases.

                Fresh berries are excellent sources of vitamin-C (100 g of berries contain 23 mg or 35% of RDA), which is a powerful natural antioxidant. Consumption of fruits rich in vitamin-C helps develop resistance against infectious agents, counter inflammation, and scavenge harmful free radicals from the human body.

                They carry adequate levels of vitamin-A, vitamin-E, and vitamin-K (16% of RDA/100 g). Further, they are rich in several other health promoting flavonoid polyphenolic antioxidants such as lutein, zeaxanthin, and ß-carotene in small amounts. Altogether, these compounds help act as protective scavengers against oxygen-derived free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that play a role in aging and various disease processes.

                Blackberries have an ORAC value (oxygen radical absorbance capacity, a measure of anti-oxidant strength) of about 5,347 µmol TE per 100 grams.

                Further, blackberries contain a good amount of minerals like potassium, manganese, copper, and magnesium. Copper is required in the bone metabolism as well as in production of white and red blood cells.

                They contain moderate levels of the B-complex group of vitamins. It contains good amounts of pyridoxine, niacin, pantothenic acid, riboflavin, and folic acid. These vitamins work as co-factors for enzymes that help metabolize carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in the human body.

            Blackcurrant is one of very popular, summer season berries. Indeed, they are incredibly rich in several valuable health benefiting phytonutrients, and antioxidants that are vital for our health.

            Blackcurrant is a small shrub belonging to the family of Grossulariaceae, of the genus; Ribes. Its scientific name: Ribes nigrum. Currants are native to central and northern Europe and Siberia. The currant (Ribes) plant is a fast growing, deciduous, small shrub reaching about 5-6 ft in height. In general, currants grow best in the regions where summers are humid but winters severe and chilling.

            During the season, Ribes nigrum bears pendulous chain of small berries. Each currant berry has a size of about 1 cm in diameter, very dark purple, almost black with a glossy skin, and a persistent calyx at its apex. It can carry about 3-10 tiny, edible seeds.

            Currants can come in different colors. Berries of red, white and pink currants feature translucent pulp, sweeter in taste. They, however, consider inferior to blackcurrants regarding antioxidant power.

            Jostaberry is hybrid of R. nigrum and other wild gooseberries.

            Health benefits of blackcurrants

                Blackcurrants carry significantly high amounts of phenolic flavonoid phytochemicals called anthocyanins. Scientific studies suggest that consumption of currants can have potential health effects against cancer, aging, inflammation, and neurological diseases.

                Blackcurrants have antioxidant value (Oxygen radical absorbance capacity- ORAC) of 7,950 Trolox Equivalents per 100g, which is one of the highest value for fruits after chokeberries, elderberry, and cranberries. Red currants, however, possess comparatively less ORAC value of 3,387 TE.

                They are excellent sources of antioxidant vitamin, vitamin-C. 100 g of fresh currants provide more than 300% of daily-recommended intake values of vitamin-C. Research studies have shown that consumption of fruits rich in vitamin-C helps the human body develop immunity against infectious agents and also help scavenge harmful oxygen-free radicals from the body.

                Black currants carry a small but significant amount of vitamin-A, and flavonoid antioxidants such as β -carotene, zeaxanthin, and cryptoxanthin levels. 100 g fresh berries provide 230 IU of vitamin-A. These compounds are known to have antioxidant properties. Vitamin-A also required for maintaining the integrity of mucosa and skin, and essential for healthy vision. Furthermore, consumption of natural fruits rich in flavonoid antioxidants helps to protect from lung and oral cavity cancers.

                Fresh blackcurrants are also rich in many essential vitamins such as pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyridoxine (vitamin B-6) and thiamin (vitamin B-1). These vitamins are essential in the sense that human body requires them from external sources to replenish and required for metabolism.

                They also carry right amounts of mineral iron. 100 g currant berries provide about 20% of daily recommended levels. Iron is an essential co-factor for cytochrome oxidase guided cellular metabolism and red blood cell (RBC) production in the bone marrow.

                Additionally, the berries are also a very good source of other important minerals like copper, calcium, phosphorus, manganese, magnesium, and potassium, which are essential for body metabolism.

            Sweet, juicy blueberries are rich in natural pro-anthocyanin pigment antioxidants. These tiny, round blue-purple berries have long been attributed to the longevity and wellness of indigenous people living around subarctic regions in the Northern hemisphere.

            Botanically, it is a deciduous shrub belonging to the family of Ericaceae, in the genus, Vaccinium.

            Broadly, Vaccinium species classified according to their growth habit as high-bush and low-bush berries.

                High-bush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) is a highly branched, erect deciduous shrub with gorgeous foliage. It grows up to 10-12 feet tall in cultivated orchards and bears clusters of small, creamy-white flowers during spring, which subsequently develop into tiny berries after about two months. In the wild, highbush blueberry found on the edges of marshes, lakes, ponds, and streams. Rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium virgatum, also known as V. ashei.) is a medium-sized shrub grows naturally in South Eastern parts of the USA.

                Lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) is a short, erect plant that grows about one-two feet in height and spread through underground rhizomes. Under the cultivated farms, it is grown as two-year cycle crop since the whole plant is either mowed down or burnt to allow new shoots that appear only during the next season.

            Both species require well-drained sandy, acidic soil to flourish. The shrub prefers open sunny conditions and intolerant of shade. In general, the berries can be ready for harvesting when they turn completely blue from green-pink, become soft, juicy, and sweeter. Traditionally, blueberries gathered by handpicking, and therefore, require intense labor. Soon after the berries separated from the shrub, they sorted out and transported to a cold facility for storage.

            Health benefits of blueberries

                Blueberries are very low in calories. 100 g fresh berries carry just 57 calories. Nonetheless, they possess essential health benefiting phytonutrients such as soluble dietary fiber, minerals, vitamins, and pigment antioxidants that contribute immensely towards optimum health and wellness.

                Blueberries are among the highest antioxidant value fruits. The ORAC value of 100 g fresh blueberry is 5562 TE (Trolex equivalents). Their antioxidant value mostly comes from poly-phenolic anthocyanidin compounds such as chlorogenic acid, tannins, myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol.

                Additionally, they compose of other flavonoid antioxidants such as carotene-ß, lutein, and zeaxanthin.

                Altogether, the phytochemical compounds in the blueberry help rid off harmful oxygen-derived free radicals from the human body, and thereby, protect it against cancers, aging, degenerative diseases, and infections.

                Further, research studies suggest that chlorogenic acid in these berries help lower blood sugar levels and control blood-glucose levels in type-II diabetes mellitus condition.

                Fresh berries carry small amount of vitamin-C, vitamin-A, and vitamin-E. Altogether, these vitamins work as potent antioxidants which help limit free radical mediated injury to the body.

                The berries also carry a small amount of B-complex group of vitamins such as niacin, pyridoxine, folates, and pantothenic acid. These vitamins are acting as co-factors that help in the metabolism of carbohydrates, protein, and fats.

                Furthermore, they contain a good amount of minerals like potassium, manganese, copper, iron and zinc. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids that helps controlling heart rate and blood pressure. Manganese used by the body as a co-factor for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase. Copper required for the production of red blood cells. Iron required for red blood cell formation.

          Wonderfully delicious and unique musky-flavored cantaloupe or “muskmelon” is a member of the large Cucurbitaceae family. Some of the popular fruits and vegetables in the Cucurbita family include squash, pumpkin, cucumber, gourd,etc., and like its relatives, melons grow along the ground surface as a trailing vine.

          Muskmelons thought to have originated either from India or ancient Persia or Africa. Inside the Australian subcontinent, they generally addressed as "rockmelons" They grow best on well-draining sandy soil with good irrigation facility and require honeybees for adequate pollination. Melons, just as mangoes, watermelon, etc., are summer season fruits. Their season runs from April through August, when they are at their best.

          Many varieties of cantaloupes grown all over the world. However, two common types that named after their place of origin have become popular in the western world. European cantaloupe (Cucumis melo cantalupensis) derives its name from the Italian papal village of "Cantalup" and features lightly-ribbed, pale green skin that looks quite different from the North American cantaloupe. Galia melon and charentais belong to this category. North American cantaloupe (Cucumis melo reticulatus), famous in the United States and some parts of Canada, is named reticulatus due to its net-like (or reticulated) skin covering. Honeydew melons have sweet, characteristic pale green succulent flesh.

          Yubari melon (Yubari king) is a special hybrid cultivar type grown in Yubari city in Hokkaido, Japan. Surrounded by mountains and well-drained volcanic ash soil, the produce commands special prize for its sweet mellow flavor.

          In general, cantaloupe fruits feature round or oblong shape, measure 4.5- 6.5 inches in diameter and weigh 450 – 850 gm, often more than a kilo. Internally, its flesh color ranges from orange-yellow to salmon, has a soft consistency and juicy texture with a sweet, musky aroma that emanates best in the completely ripe fruits. At its center, there is a hollow cavity filled with small off-white color seeds encased in a web of mucilaginous netting.

          Health Benefits of Cantaloupe

              Wonderfully delicious with rich flavor, cantaloupes are very low in calories (100 g fruit has just 34 calories) and fats. Nonetheless, the fruit is rich in numerous health promoting polyphenolic plant derived compounds, vitamins, and minerals that are absolute for optimum health.

              The fruit is an excellent source of Vitamin-A, (100 g provides 3382 IU or about 112% of recommended daily levels) one of the highest among cucurbita fruits. Vitamin-A is a powerful antioxidant and is essential for healthy vision. It also required for maintaining healthy mucosa and skin. Consumption of natural fruits rich in vitamin-A has been known to help protect from lung and oral cavity cancers.

              Cantaloupes also rich in antioxidant flavonoids such as beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and cryptoxanthin. These antioxidants have the ability to help protect cells and other structures in the body from oxygen-free radicals and hence; offer protection against colon, prostate, breast, endometrial, lung, and pancreatic cancers.

              Total antioxidant strength regarding oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) of cantaloupe melons is 315 µmol TE/100 g. The value for honeydew melon is 241 µmol TE/100 g.

              Zeaxanthin, an important dietary carotenoid, selectively absorbed into the retinal macula lutea in the eye where it is thought to provide antioxidant and protective UV light-filtering functions. It, thus, offers protection of eyes from "Age-related macular degeneration" (ARMD) disease in the elderly.

              It is an ideal source of electrolyte, potassium. 100 g fruit provides 267 mg of this electrolyte. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids and helps control heart rate and blood pressure. It thus offers protection against stroke and coronary heart diseases.

              The fruit also contains moderate levels of B-complex vitamins, such as niacin, pantothenic acid, and vitamin C, and minerals like manganese. Consumption of foods rich in vitamin-C helps the human body develop resistance against infectious agents and scavenge harmful oxygen-free radicals. The human body uses manganese as a co-factor for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase. Commercially, muskmelons are being used to extract an enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD), which plays a vital role as a first-line antioxidant defenses in the human body.

          Sweet, pulpy, and fragrant rich cherimoya is one of the most delicious tropical fruits of Andean valley origin. These greenish-yellow, conical fruits are from the evergreen trees belonging to the family Annonaceae, in the genus of Annona. The plant has been thought to be native to Loja region of Ecuador, bordering Peru, the low rising tropical forests of Central Andean Mountains.

          Annona is a small-sized tree, grows to about 15 to 30 feet tall with dense foliage, and bears fruits after 4-5 years of plantation. At their natural habitat, cherimoya flowers are pollinated by insects (Coleoptera, Hemiptera). However, in the cultivated farms, artificial pollination is done at large to obtain good yields.

          The fruit is irregularly oval or conical in shape, features leathery dark-green skin with polygonal indentations. It measures about 10-15 cm in length and 10 cm in diameter and weighs about 350 g to 500 g, and in some varieties weighing several pounds. Ripe fruits turn pale green to light brown and emanate sweet, fragrant aroma that can be appreciated from a distance. Inside it features, creamy pulp with smooth, shiny, black seeds embedded in the flesh. Seeds and skin are inedible.

          Custard apple (Annona reticulata) is another small size fruit commonly grown in India, Pakistan and other South Asian regions. It features smooth, conical indentations.

          Sugar apple or atis fruit (A. squamosa) features smooth conical protuberances (carpels) over its surface. It has similar taste and flavor as cherimoya; however, on its interior, it contains relatively less flesh but more seeds for its size.

          Atemoya is hybrid of cherimoya (A. cherimola) and sugar apple (A. squamosa). It has better temperature and humidity tolerance, suitable for cultivation under tropical climates.

          Guanabana (Annona muricata), also known as soursop (graviola), is much larger than cherimoya. It is easily distinguished by its size, spiky surface, and fibrous, tart flesh.

          Health benefits of cherimoya

              Very sweet and pleasant flavor annonas contain an impressive list of essential nutrients, vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals.

              The fruit has calories equivalent to that of mangoes. 100 g of fresh fruit pulp provide about 75 calories. It, however, contain no saturated fats or cholesterol. The fruit characteristically is a good source of soluble dietary fiber (3 g% or 8% of RDA) which helps lower absorption of cholesterol in the gut. The fiber also helps protect the colon mucosa from exposure to toxic substances by binding cancer-causing chemicals to it.

              Cherimoya contains several polyphenolic antioxidants. Among them, the most prominent in Annona family fruits are Annonaceous acetogenins. Acetogenin compounds such as asimicin, bullatacinare, etc., are powerful cytotoxins and have been found to have anti-cancer, anti-malarial, and anti-helminth properties.

              It is very good in vitamin-C. Vitamin-C is a powerful natural antioxidant. Soursop (A.muricata) relatively has more vitamin-C (34% of RDA). Consumption of fruits rich in vitamin-C helps the human body develop resistance against infectious agents and scavenge harmful, pro-inflammatory free radicals from the body.

              Also, cherimoya fruit is a good source of B-complex vitamins, especially vitamin B-6 (pyridoxine). 100 g fresh fruit provides 0.257 mg or 20% of daily recommended levels. Pyridoxine helps keep up GABA neurochemical levels in the brain. High GABA levels calm down nervous irritability, tension, and headache ailments.

              Further, it has a well balanced sodium-potassium ratio. A good potassium level in the body helps control heart rate and blood pressure, and thus, counters bad influences of sodium. It also contains more minerals weight per weight than many common fruits like apples, being rich in copper, magnesium, iron and manganese.

          Wonderfully delicious, cherry fruit is packed with full of health-benefiting nutrients and unique antioxidants. Cherries are native to Eastern Europe and Asia Minor regions.

          Botanically, the fruit is a “drupe” (stone fruit), belonging to the large Rosaceae family of small tree fruits in the genus, Prunus. Some of the common “drupe” family fruits are plums, peaches, apricots, etc. Although several species of cherries exist, two popular cultivars are wild or sweet cherry and sour or tart cherry. While sweet cherries belong to the species of Prunus avium, tart variety belongs to that of Prunus cerasus.

          Cherries are drupe fruits with a central “stony-hard” seed surrounded by fleshy edible pulp. They come in small sizes, measuring about 2 cm in diameter. Externally they covered by bright "shiny" red or purple, thin peel.

          The West Indian cherry, known as acerola (Malpighia emarginata), is native to West Indian islands and grown in Mexico, and Texas regions in North America. Acerola belongs to the tropical fruit-bearing shrubs in the family Malpighiaceae and contains 2-3 tiny seeds. Acerola composes exceptionally high levels of vitamin-C and vitamin-A than North American and European cherries.

          Health benefits of cherry fruit

              Cherry fruit nutrition featured by very low-calorific value and negligible fats. Nonetheless, cherries are a rich source of phytonutrients, vitamins, and minerals. Both sweet, as well as tart cherries, are packed with numerous health benefiting compounds that are essential for wellness.

              Cherries are pigment rich fruits. These pigments, in fact, are polyphenolic flavonoid compounds known as anthocyanin glycosides. Anthocyanins are red, purple or blue pigments found in many fruits and vegetables, especially concentrated in their skin, known to have powerful antioxidant properties.

              Scientific studies have shown that anthocyanins in the cherries are found to act like anti-inflammatory drugs by blocking the actions of enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 and 2. Thus, consumption of cherries may offer potential health effects against chronic painful episodes such as gout arthritis, fibromyalgia (painful muscle condition) and sports injuries.

              Research studies also suggest that antioxidant compounds in tart cherries can help the human body fight against cancers, aging and neurological diseases, and pre-diabetes condition.

              Cherries compose of melatonin antioxidant. Melatonin can cross the blood-brain barrier easily and has soothing effects on the brain neurons, calming down nervous system irritability. It, thus, can help relieve neurosis, insomnia and headaches.

              Further, they are also a minor source of minerals like zinc, iron, potassium, and manganese. Surprisingly good source of copper. Potassium is a beneficial electrolyte which is an important component of cell and body fluids that regulate heart rate and blood pressure.

              They, especially tart cherries, are exceptionally rich in health promoting flavonoid poly phenolic antioxidants such as lutein, zeaxanthin, and β -carotene. These compounds act as protective scavengers against harmful free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that play a role in aging, cancers and various disease processes.

              Anti-inflammatory property of cherries has been found effective in reducing heart-disease risk factors through scavenging action against free radicals.

              Acerola or West Indian cherry has exceptionally very high levels of vitamin-C (1677.6 mg per 100 g or 2796 % of RDA) and vitamin-A (767 IU per 100 g).

The berries are indeed composed of numerous health benefiting chemical substances that may offer protection from tooth cavities, urinary tract infection, and inflammatory diseases.

          The plant can be described as an evergreen, dwarf, creeping shrub or a low-lying trailing vine. It belongs to the family of Ericaceae, in the genus: Vaccinium, and subgenus: Oxycoccos. Scientific name: Vaccinium macrocarpon.

          In its natural habitat, the cranberry plant grows vigorously in acidic sandy bogs, all across the temperate and cooler parts of Europe, Northern states in the United States and Canada. The plant is a dwarf, creeping shrub, or vine, which runs up to 10 to 20 cm in height. It features slender, wiry, not so thick, woody stems bearing small, evergreen leaves.

          Cranberry season lasts from October until December. The fruit is small, round, red color berry. Each berry features four centrally placed tiny seeds enclosed in capsules. The berry is very acidic in taste, with pH in the range of 2.3 to 2.5.

          Health Benefits of Cranberries

              Delicious, tart cranberries hold significantly high amounts of phenolic flavonoid phytochemicals called proanthocyanidins (PAC’s). Scientific studies have shown that consumption of berries has potential health benefits against cancer, aging and neurological diseases, inflammation, diabetes, and bacterial infections.

              Antioxidant compounds such as oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPC’s), anthocyanidin flavonoids, cyanidin, peonidin and quercetin in cranberries may offer protection against cardiovascular disease by counteracting against cholesterol plaque formation in the heart and blood vessels. Further, these compounds help the human body lower LDL cholesterol levels and increase HDL-good cholesterol levels in the blood.

              Research studies suggest that drinking cranberry juice can protect against gram-negative bacterial infections such as E.coli in the urinary system by inhibiting bacterial attachment to the bladder and urethral mucosal wall.

              Consumption of cranberries turns urine acidic. Together with inhibition of bacterial adhesion actions (proteus bacterial-infections), cranberry juice can help prevent the formation of alkaline (calcium-ammonium-phosphate) stones inside the urinary tract.

              Further, the berries prevent plaque formation on the tooth enamel by interfering with the ability of another gram-negative bacterium, Streptococcus mutans, to stick to the tooth surface. It thus helps prevent the development of cavities.

              Also, the berries are also a good source of many vitamins like vitamin-C, vitamin-A, and folate and phenolics like ß-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and minerals like potassium, and manganese.

              Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity or ORAC (measurement of the antioxidant strength of food items) demonstrates cranberry at an ORAC score of 9584 µmol TE units per 100 g, one of the highest among edible berries.

The tree is believed to originate in the lands on the banks of Nile and Euphrates Rivers of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Date palm is now grown extensively for its edible fruits under warmer climates across all the continents.

            The date fruit is a "drupe," in which its outer fleshy part (exocarp and mesocarp) surrounds a shell (the pit or stone) of hardened endocarp with a seed inside. The fruit is oval to cylindrical in shape, 3–7 cms long, and 2–3 cms diameter, and ripe dates range from golden yellow, amber, bright-red to deep-brown depending on the cultivar type.

            There are many varieties of date palm cultivated. ‘Amir Hajj,’ ‘Saidy,’ 'Khadrawy' and 'Medjool' are some of the important varieties popular for their rich taste, flavor, and superior quality.

            Health benefits of dates

                Wonderfully delicious, dates are one of the most popular fruits packed with an impressive list of phyotnutrients, vitamins, and minerals that are essential for normal growth, development, and overall well-being.

                Fresh dates compose of soft, easily digestible flesh and simple sugars like fructose and dextrose. 100 g of mejdool dates hold 277 calories. When eaten, they replenish energy and revitalize the body instantly. For these qualities, they traditionally served to break the fast during Ramadan month since ancient times.

                The fruit is rich in dietary fiber, which prevents LDL cholesterol absorption in the gut. Additionally, the fiber diet works as a bulk laxative. It, thus, helps protect the colon mucous membrane from cancer-causing chemicals binding to it in the colon.

                They contain health benefiting flavonoid polyphenolic antioxidants known as tannins. Tannins are known to possess anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, and anti-hemorrhagic (prevent easy bleeding tendencies) properties.

                They are minor sources of vitamin-A (contains 149 IU or 5% of RDA per 100 g), which is known to have antioxidant properties and essential for vision. Additionally, it is also required maintaining healthy mucosa and skin. Consumption of natural fruits rich in vitamin-A is known to help protect from lung and oral cavity cancers.

                They compose antioxidant flavonoids such as ß-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin. These antioxidants found to have the ability to protect cells and other structures in the body from harmful effects of oxygen-free radicals. Thus, eating dates found to offer some protection from colon, prostate, breast, endometrial, lung, and pancreatic cancers.

                Zeaxanthin is an important dietary carotenoid that selectively absorbed into the retinal macula lutea, where it thought to provide antioxidant and protective light-filtering functions. It thus offers protection against age-related macular degeneration, especially in the older adults.

                Dates are excellent source of iron, carry 0.90 mg/100 g of fruits (about 11% of RDI). Iron, being a component of hemoglobin inside the red blood cells, determines the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.

                Further, they are excellent sources of potassium. 100 g contains 696 mg or 16% of daily recommended levels of this electrolyte. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids that help regulate heart rate and blood pressure. They, thus, offer protection against stroke and coronary heart diseases.

                Date fruits are also rich in minerals like calcium, manganese, copper, and magnesium. Calcium is an important mineral that is an essential constituent of bone and teeth and required by the body for muscle contraction, blood clotting, and nerve impulse conduction. The human body uses manganese as a co-factor for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase. Copper required for the production of red blood cells. Magnesium is essential for bone growth.

                Further, the fruit has moderate levels of the B-complex group of vitamins as well as vitamin-K. It contains healthy amounts of pyridoxine (vitamin B-6), niacin, pantothenic acid, and riboflavin. These vitamins are acting as cofactors help body metabolize carbohydrates, protein, and fats. Vitamin-K is essential for many coagulant factors in the blood as well as in bone metabolism.

          Tiny, round elderberry is the storehouse of health benefiting anthocyanin antioxidants. Early settlers of North America were well acquainted with the medicinal uses of elder flowers and berries long before the Spanish and other European explorers re-discovered about its uses. These small round blue-purple berries have long been attributed to the longevity and wellness of indigenous natives around arctic regions of the Northern hemisphere.

          Elderberry is actually a small, deciduous tree that grows up to 7 to 10 meters tall. In cultivated orchards, their natural height is often allowed for only few meters to help lateral spread and fruit production.

          The plant starts flowering during the second year of plantation and fruiting in its third year. White or cream flowers in clusters cover the plant during early summer. Small, round, 8 to 10 mm black or purple berries appear subsequently which can be ready for harvesting by June and the season lasts until September.

          At maturity, elderberries in clusters hang upside down as the stem often bent under the weight. A single cluster may hold hundreds of berries. Harvesting is done by handpicking.

          European elderberries (S. nigra/ black elder) are intensely tart and rarely edible raw. American elder (S. canadensis) or "common elder" are relatively sweeter and tart. Only Blue or purple elders are edible, and other color variants are just avoided for their possible toxicity.

          Both species require well-drained sandy, nitrogen rich soil to flourish. Just as in blueberry shrub, it too prefers open sunny conditions and intolerant of shade. In general, these berries can be ready for harvesting when they completely tuen black or deep purple, and soft.

          Health benefits of elderberry

              100 g of fresh elderberries carry 73 calories. These tiny berries possess several unique health benefiting plant nutrients such as pigment flavonoid antioxidants, anthocyanins, minerals, and vitamins that contribute immensely towards robust health and wellness.

              The berries possess one of the highest antioxidant strength among edible berries. ORAC value of 100 g fresh elderberry is 10775 TE (Trolox equivalents), whereas it is only 5562 TE for blueberries. Just as in blueberries, their antioxidant value too largely comes from polyphenolic flavonoid compounds such as flavonoids isorhamnetin, kaempferol, quercetin, etc. Together, these compounds help scavenge free oxygen radicals from the human body, and thereby, protect it from cancers, aging, degenerative diseases, and infections.

              Fresh elderberries are excellent sources of vitamin-C. 100 g carry 36 mg or 60% of the daily recommended intake levels of vitamin-C. Vitamin-C is one of the powerful water-soluble natural antioxidants which works against the viral flu. It also helps boost immunity, healing of wounds, fight against cancers and required by the body for the repair of tissues and cartilage.

              Elderberries are also incredible sources of vitamin-A (provide 600 IU or 20% of RDA per 100 g), several times more than that of in other berries like blueberry (54 IU/100 g), chokeberry (214 IU/100 g), etc. Vitamin-A is an essential nutrient required for maintaining healthy mucosa and skin and is required for good eye health. Consumption of natural fruits rich in flavonoids and vitamin-A may help protect from lung and oral cavity cancers.

              The berries also carry a relatively good amount of B-complex group of vitamins such as niacin, pyridoxine (18% RDI /100g), folates and pantothenic acid. These vitamins work as co-factors for those enzymes that help in the metabolism of carbohydrates, protein, and fats.

              Furthermore, they contain a good amount of minerals like calcium, potassium, manganese, iron and phosphorus. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids that helps controlling heart rate and blood pressure. The body uses manganese as a cofactor for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase. Copper is essential for the production of red blood cells. Iron is required for red blood cell formation.

          Medicinal uses of elderberry

              Only flower and ripe berries of elder plant are edible. Other plant parts including its bark, leaf, and root carry high levels of toxic alkaloids and should be avoided.

              Berries and flower too found use in several traditional medicines around the world. Elderberry flower cordial has been a common household remedy for flu symptoms.

              Its fruit extraction found its utility as anti-catarrhal (prevents cold), expectorant (anti-tussive), circulatory stimulant, and local anti-inflammatory actions.

          Delicious, sweet fig fruit is one of the popular fruits enjoyed since ancient times. Fig is rich in natural health benefiting phytonutrients, antioxidants, and vitamins. Entirely developed and ripe fig features bell or pear shape with succulent, juicy flesh inside. Dried figs, indeed, are a highly concentrated source of minerals and vitamins.

          Botanically figs belong to the mulberry family (Moraceae), in the genus: Ficus.

          The fig tree is native to temperate regions of Asia Minor or Turkey, and today, grown as an important fruit of commerce in the eastern Mediterranean climates, USA, and Spain. It also cultivated as a fruit tree in the home gardens in many other regions as well. During each season, fig bears several hundreds of pear-shaped fruits twice a year, which vary in size and color depending on the variety.

          Interiorly, fig fruit features numerous, tiny club-shaped ovaries extending towards the central hollow cavity. In their natural habitat, “caprifigs” pollinated by tiny "gall wasp" (Blastophaga psenes) insect that enters flower clusters through a small opening at the apex.

          Several cultivars of fig exist; some of the traditional varieties commonly grown in the USA are Brown Turkey, Conadria, Kadota, and Black mission. However, since the wasp does not exist in the North America, most of these fruits develop by parthenogenesis (without pollination) and therefore, do not possess "true" seeds.

          Health benefits of figs

              Fig fruit is low in calories. 100 g fresh fruits carry only 74 calories. However, they contain health benefiting soluble dietary fiber, minerals, vitamins, and pigment antioxidants that contribute immensely towards optimum health and wellness.

              Dried figs are an excellent source of minerals, vitamins and antioxidants. In fact, dried figs possess higher concentrations of energy, minerals, and vitamins. 100 g dried figs provide 249 calories.

              Fresh figs, especially black mission, contain polyphenolic flavonoid antioxidants such as carotenes, lutein, tannins, chlorogenic acid, etc. Their antioxidant value is comparable to that of apples at 3200 umol/100 g (Trolox equivalents).

              Additionally, fresh figs contain adequate levels of some of the anti-oxidant vitamins such as vitamin-A, E, and K. Altogether these phytochemical compounds in fig fruit help scavenge harmful oxygen-derived free radicals from the human body and thereby protect us from cancers, diabetes, degenerative diseases, and infections.

              Furthermore, research studies suggest that chlorogenic acid in the figs help lower blood sugar levels and control blood glucose levels in type-II diabetes mellitus (adult-onset) condition.

              Fresh, as well as dried figs, contain healthy levels of a B-complex group of vitamins such as niacin, pyridoxine, folates, and pantothenic acid. These vitamins function as co-factors for metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.

              Dried figs are excellent sources of minerals like calcium, copper, potassium, manganese, iron, selenium and zinc. 100 g of dried figs contain 680 mg of potassium, 162 mg of calcium, and 2.03 mg of iron. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids that helps controlling heart rate and blood pressure. Copper required in the production of red blood cells. Iron is essential for red blood cell formation as well for cellular oxidation. (Source: USDA National Nutrient Database).

          In Chinese legends, goji berry symbolizes longevity of life. These tiny orange-red color berries obtained from a nightshade family plant growing naturally in many Asian and Mediterranean regions.

          Botanically, goji belongs to the Solanaceae (nightshade) family of plants. Wolfberry, matrimony vine are other names to goji. Eggplant, tomato, potato are other interesting family members in this nightshade family.

          Scientific name: Lycium barbarum. Ningxia province in Northwest China is the important region where wolfberry grew on a commercial scale. Goji berries grown in Ningxia, especially in Zhongning, are renowned worldwide for their exceptional quality.

          Goji berry is a deciduous, thick woody vine that prefers loamy, well-drained soil. The two common goji cultivars grown in China are L. barbarum, and L. chinense (Chinese wolfberry). L. barbarum or NingXia (Gou Qi) berries considered as the best and most popular in the western world.

          Goji reaches about 2-3 meters in height and begins fruit yielding by the second year of plantation. The plant bears small, purple color flowers in the summer which undergo self-pollination to develop green, raw berries in bunches. The berries turn deep orange-red and can be ready for harvesting by August. Each berry measures about 2 to 2.5 cm in length and 1 cm in diameter, has ellipsoid shape and waxy, glossy skin. Inside, it consists of tiny, creamy-white, flat seeds interspersed at its center. Traditionally, fresh berries harvested by hand-picking and sun-dried for several days, sorted and dispatch for markets.

          Every year during the harvesting time, locals in the Ningxia province celebrate goji berry festival in the month of August to commemorate the importance of goji berry in their culture.

          Health benefits of goji berry

              L. barbarum plant parts, including fruits, leaves, flowers, have long been recognized as a functional food praised in Chinese culture. The berries, in particular, are packed with an impressive list of essential nutrients, anti-oxidants, vitamins, and minerals.

              Dry, red ripe goji berries are concentrated sources of carotenoids, calories, vitamins, and minerals.

              Antioxidant carotenoids and flavonoids found abundantly in goji berries. β -carotene, zeaxanthin, cryptoxanthin, and lutein play a vital role in protecting the skin and mucosa from free radical injury.

              Certain flavonoids found in goji berries are quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, hesperidin and rutin. They act as antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer agents.

              Zeaxanthin is a natural antioxidant which has UV (ultra-violet) rays filtering actions in the macula lutea portion of the retina in the eyes. Thus, it may offer protection from "age-related macular disease" (ARMD) in the elderly.

              Fresh, as well as, dried goji are excellent sources of vitamin-A. 100 g of dried berries carry astoundingly 26,822 IU of vitamin-A. Vitamin-A is a powerful natural anti-oxidant and is required by the body for maintaining the integrity of skin and mucosa. It is also an essential vitamin for good vision. Research studies suggest that natural foods rich in this vitamin may help the human body protect against lung and oral cavity cancers.

              Vitamin C is another natural anti-oxidant found in right concentration in goji. 100 grams of dried goji composes 48.4 mg or 80% of daily required levels of this vitamin.

              Dried goji berries are an excellent source of calcium (190 mg or 19% of RDI), iron 6.80 mg/100 g of fruits (about 85% of RDI). Iron, being a component of hemoglobin inside the red blood cells, determines the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Calcium is an important mineral that is an essential constituent of bone and teeth and required by the body for muscle contraction, blood clotting, and nerve impulse conduction.

              Further, fresh as well as dry berries carry adequate daily recommended levels of the B-complex group of vitamins. Dried goji contains very good amounts of pyridoxine (vitamin B-6), thiamin niacin, pantothenic acid, and riboflavin. These vitamins are acting as cofactors help the human body metabolize carbohydrates, protein, and fats.

          Medicinal uses of goji berry

              Almost all parts of the goji plant have been found utilization in the traditional Chinese medicine. Chinese physicians advocate different parts of the plant for each of the four divisions of the year. Its leaf in spring, flower in summer, fruits in autumn and root in winter.

          Gooseberries are small, round to oval berries of European origin. They grow in the wild all over the temperate climates of Europe, North America, and Siberia. Botanically, they related very closely to currants, and belong to the same family of Grossulariaceae, in the genus, Ribes. These berries packed with pigment antioxidant polyphenolics, and vitamins.

          Gooseberries (R. uva-crispa L.) are one of the four wild Ribes species (R. alpinum L., R. rubrum L. and R. petraeum Wulf.) growing in the Northern Hemisphere. As in currants, gooseberry grows best in regions where summers are humid, but winter is severe and chilling.

          Gooseberry plant is a fast growing, a small deciduous shrub growing about 4-6 ft in height, featuring sharp thorns all along its woody branches. The plant begins fruiting 2-3 years after plantation. Berries come in many shapes, colors, and taste. They can be round, oval, pear-shaped or elongated, green, white, yellow, purple, red-brown or black color, sweet and tart. Their outer surface can be smooth or fuzzy (hairy) with conspicuous veins. Inside, a berry may hold 15-30 tiny edible seeds. In general, the berries measure 1-2 cm in width and weigh about 4 g to 10 g.

          Indian gooseberries, also known as amla in the subcontinent, belongs to a different family of Euphorbiaceae. Their scientific name is Phyllanthus emblica. Indian gooseberry features round to transversely spherical shape with light green color. Amla berries are exceptionally high in anti-oxidants and vitamin C. For the same reason; they are excessively acidic and bitter (astringent) in taste.

          Cape gooseberry (Physalis peruviana), also known as Peruvian cherry in the US, is native to South American Andes region. The berries are small, round, orange-yellow in color, encased inside a Chinese lantern like a papery thin husk.

          Health benefits of gooseberries

              Gooseberries are low in calories; 100 g of fresh berries hold just 44 calories. As in blackcurrants, they too have significantly high amounts of phenolic phytochemicals, especially flavones and anthocyanins. Both of these compounds have been found to have numerous health-benefiting effects against cancer, aging, inflammation, and neurological diseases.

              They moderately good in anti-oxidant values. At 3277 μmol TE/100g, gooseberries have oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) value, which can be comparable to that of red currants (3387umol TE/100g).

              The berries are an excellent source of vitamin-C. 100 g of fresh berries provide 27.7 μg or 46% of daily-recommended intake values of vitamin C. Research studies have shown that consumption of fruits rich in vitamin-C helps the human body develop immunity against infectious agents, and help scavenge harmful oxygen free radicals from the human body.

              They carry a small amount of vitamin-A. 100 g berries have 290 IU or 10% of RDA of this vitamin. Vitamin-A required for maintaining the integrity of mucosa and skin and essential component of the visual cycle. Also, consumption of natural fruits rich in vitamins and flavonoid antioxidants has been found to protect from lung and oral cavity cancers.

              Fresh berries contain small amounts of essential vitamins such as pyridoxine (vitamin B-6), pantothenic acid (vitamin B-5), folates, and thiamin (vitamin B-1). Some of these vitamins are essential in the sense that the body requires them for metabolism from external sources to replenish.

              Furthermore, gooseberries contain moderate levels of minerals such as copper, calcium, phosphorus, manganese, magnesium, and potassium.

              Indian gooseberries (amla) are exceptionally rich in vitamin C. 100 g of amla carry astoundingly 445 mg of vitamin-C. However, their much of anti-oxidant properties come from other anti-oxidant compounds in them like tannins (emblicanin, punigluconin, pedunculagin, etc.).

          One of the most popular among the regularly featuring table fruits, grapes are widely considered as the "queen of fruits" since earlier times. These tiny berries of the Europe and Mediterranean origin are the storehouse of numerous health-promoting phytonutrients such as polyphenolic antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. No wonder why so many of us often include them in our diet; be it as a fresh table fruits, dry fruits (raisins), juice, or simply in salads!

          Botanically, they are small, round berries growing in clusters on a perennial and deciduous woody vine of the genus, Vitis. Today, they widely cultivated under supervised orchards and vineyards all around the world.

          In structure, each grape berry features semi-translucent flesh encased inside a smooth, thin skin. Some varieties contain edible seeds, while others are seedless. The color of the berry is because of the presence of polyphenolic pigments in them. Red or purple berries are rich in anthocyanins while white-green berries compose more of tannins, especially, catechin. Interestingly, these antioxidant compounds concentrated densely in the skin and seeds!

          The three most important species of grapes grown around the world are; European (Vitis vinifera), North American (Vitis labrusca, and Vitis rotundifolia), and French hybrids.

              Some of the popular green cultivars are Thompson seedless, sugarone, and calmeria.

              Red varieties include emperor, red globe, cardinal, and flame seedless.

              Concord and zinfandel are some of the flavorful blue-black cultivars.

          Commercially, many cultivars of grapes are grown for different purposes either to be eaten as table fruit, fresh or dried (raisin, currant, sultana) or in wine production.

          Health benefits of grapes

              Grapes are rich in polyphenolic phytochemical compound resveratrol. Resveratrol is one of the powerful anti-oxidant which has been found to play a protective role against cancers of colon and prostate, coronary heart disease (CHD), degenerative nerve disease, Alzheimer's disease and viral/ fungal infections.

              Resveratrolreduces stroke risk by altering the molecular mechanisms inside the blood vessels. It does so, firstly by reducing the susceptibility of the blood vessel through decreased activity of angiotensin (a systemic hormone causing blood vessel constriction that would otherwise elevate blood pressure) and secondly, through increased production of vasodilator substance, nitric oxide (a beneficial compound that causes relaxation of blood vessels).

              Anthocyanins are another class of polyphenolic antioxidants present abundantly in the red grapes. These phytochemicals have been found to have an anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, as well as anti-cancer activity.

              Catechins, a type of flavonoid tannin group of anti-oxidants, discovered in the white/green varieties have also shown to possess these health-protective functions.

              Also, the berries are very low in calories. 100 g fresh grapes just provide 69 calories but zero cholesterol levels.

              Grapes are a rich source of micronutrient minerals like copper, iron, and manganese. Copper and manganese are an essential cofactor of the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase. Iron is especially concentrated in raisins. Besides, 100 g of fresh grapes contain about 191 mg of health benefiting electrolyte, potassium.

              They are an also good source of vitamin-C, vitamin-A, vitamin-K, carotenes, B-complex vitamins such as pyridoxine, riboflavin, and thiamin.

The fruit is well known as "fruit of the paradise" for its unique health-promoting as well as disease preventing properties, in particular among the health-conscious, fitness enthusiasts.

          Citrus paradisi is a subtropical citrus tree. Botanically, it belongs to the large Rutaceae family of citrus fruits, of the genus: Citrus, and closely related to oranges.

          Grapefruit is an evergreen, medium-sized tree grown for its fruit. It grows up to 15 meters in height and bears many yellow-orange fruits in clusters during each season. It is, in fact, a natural hybridization of pomelo and orange.

          It was first discovered in the forests of Caribbean island, Barbados. Today, it is one of the widely cultivated fruits in the United States, particularly in Florida, California, and other semi-tropical Southern states.

          Grapefruit is oblate in shape, ranges in diameter from 3 to 5 inches and can weigh up to 150 g. Characteristically, it has thick, tough skin than that in the oranges. On the interior, arils arranged in segments as in other citrus fruits. Its arils are very juicy, acidic, and varying in color depending on the cultivars, which could be white, pink and red of varying sweetness. While some varieties are seedless, there may be up to 50 white, elliptical, pointed seeds about 1/2 inches in length seen in some.

          Health Benefits of Grapefruit

              Delicious, grapefruit is very low in calories, consists of just 42 calories per 100 g. Nonetheless; it is rich in dietary insoluble fiber pectin, which works as a bulk laxative. Dietary fiber helps to protect the colon mucosa by decreasing exposure time to toxic substances in the colon as well as binding to cancer-causing chemicals in the colon.

              Pectin has also been shown to reduce blood cholesterol levels by decreasing re-absorption of cholesterol in the colon.

              The fruit contains very healthy levels of vitamin-A (provides about 1150 IU per 100g), and flavonoid antioxidants such as naringenin, and naringin. Additionally, it is a moderate source of lycopene, β-carotene, xanthin, and lutein. Studies suggest that these compounds have antioxidant properties and are essential for vision. The total antioxidant strength measured in terms of oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) of grapefruit is 1,548 µmol TE/100 g.

              Further, vitamin-A also required maintaining healthy mucosa and skin. Consumption of natural fruits rich in vitamin-A and flavonoids helps to protect from lung and oral cavity cancers.

              It is an excellent source of antioxidant vitamin-C; providing about 52% of DRI. Vitamin-C is a powerful natural anti-oxidant and helps the body develop resistance against infectious agents and scavenge harmful free radicals. It, furthermore, is required for the maintenance of healthy connective tissue and aids in early wound healing. It also facilitates dietary iron absorption in the intestine.

              100 g of fresh fruit contains about 135 mg of potassium electrolyte. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids, helps regulate heart rate and blood pressure through countering sodium effects.

              The red variety grapefruits especially rich in powerful flavonoid antioxidant, lycopene. Studies show that lycopene protects skin from dangerous UV rays, and offers protection against prostate cancer.

              Additionally, it contains moderate levels of the B-complex group of vitamins such as folates, riboflavin, pyridoxine, and thiamin in addition to some resourceful minerals such as iron, calcium, copper, and phosphorus.

          The fruit is soft when ripe with sweet musky aroma and creamy texture. Internally, its flesh varies in color depending up on the cultivar and may be white, pink, yellow, or red. Ripe fruits have a rich flavor with a sweet-tart taste. Each fruit contains numerous tiny, semi-hard edible seeds, concentrated especially at its center.

          Health benefits of guava fruit

              Guava is low in calories and fats but carry several vital vitamins, minerals, and antioxidant polyphenolic and flavonoid compounds that play a pivotal role in the prevention of cancers, aging, infections, etc.

              The fruit is a very rich source of soluble dietary fiber (5.4 g per 100 g of fruit, about 14% of DRA), which makes it a good bulk laxative. The fiber content helps protect the colon mucosa by decreasing exposure time to toxins as well as binding to cancer-causing chemicals in the colon.

              Guava-fruit is an excellent source of antioxidant vitamin-C. 100 g fresh fruit provides 228 mg of this vitamin, more than three times the required DRI (daily-recommended intake). Flesh just underneath its thick outer rind composes exceptionally higher levels of vitamin-C than its inner creamy pulp.

              Scientific studies suggest that regular consumption of fruits rich in vitamin-C helps the human body develop resistance against infectious agents and scavenge cancer causing harmful free radicals from the body. Further, it is essential for collagen synthesis within the body. Collagen is one of the chief structural protein in the human body necessary for maintaining the integrity of blood vessels, skin, organs, and bones.

              The fruit is a very good source of Vitamin-A, and flavonoids like beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein and cryptoxanthin. The compounds are known to have antioxidant properties and therefore essential for optimum health. Further, is also critical to maintaining healthy mucosa and skin. Consumption of natural fruits rich in carotene is known to protect from lung and oral cavity cancers.

              100 g of pink guava fruit provides 5204 µg of lycopene, nearly twice the amount than in tomatoes. (100 g tomato contains 2573 µg of lycopene). Studies suggest that lycopene in pink guavas prevents skin damage from UV rays and offer protection from prostate cancer.

              Fresh fruit is a very rich source of potassium. It contains more potassium than other fruits like banana weight per weight. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids that helps controlling heart rate and blood pressure.

              Further, the fruit is also a moderate source of B-complex vitamins such as pantothenic acid, niacin, vitamin-B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin E and K, as well as minerals like magnesium, copper, and manganese. The human body uses manganese as a co-factor for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase. Copper required for the production of red blood cells.

          Jackfruit is absolutely one of a kind tropical fruit recognized for its unique shape, and size. The fruity flavor of its sweet arils (bulbs) can be appreciated from a distance. In common with other tropical fruits such as durian, banana, etc., it is also rich in energy, dietary fiber, minerals, and vitamins and free from saturated fats or cholesterol; fitting it into one of the healthy treats to relish!

          Botanically, this popular Asian tropical fruit belongs to the family of Moraceae, of the genus: Artocarpus and is closely related to figs, mulberry, and breadfruit.

          Jackfruit is a huge tree that grows to as high as 30 meters, larger than mango, breadfruit, etc. It is believed to be indigenous to the Southwestern rain forests of India. Today, it widely cultivated in the tropical regions of the Indian subcontinent, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brazil for its fruit, seeds, and wood. The tree grows best in tropical humid and rainy climates but rarely survives cold and frosty conditions.

          In a season, each tree bears as many as 250 large fruits, supposed to be the biggest tree-borne fruits in the world. The fruit varies widely in size, weigh from 3 to 30 kg, and has oblong or round shape, measuring 10 cm to 60 cm in length, 25 to 75 cm in diameter. While unripe fruits are green, they turn light brown and spread a strong sweet, fruity smell once ripe.

          As in the durian fruit, the outer surface of the jackfruit is also covered by blunt spikes which become soft as the fruit ripen.

          Its interior consists of eye-catching orange-yellow color edible bulbs. Each bulb consists of sweet flesh (sheath) that encloses a smooth, oval, light-brown seed. There may be as many as 50 to 500 edible bulbs embedded in a single fruit interspersed in-between thin bands of fibers.

          Jackfruit seed encased inside a thin, transparent outer cover. It largely composes of starch and protein. Each seed measures about 2 to 4 cm in length, and 1 to 3 cm in thickness.

          Almost all the parts of the tree secrete white sticky latex-like milk (juice) upon infliction of injury.

          Health benefits of jackfruit

              100 g of edible jackfruit bulbs provide 95 calories. The fruit made of soft, easily digestible flesh (arils) made up of simple sugars like fructose and sucrose that when eaten replenishes energy and revitalizes the body instantly.

              Jackfruit is rich in dietary fiber, which makes it a good bulk laxative. The fiber content helps protect the colon mucosa by binding to and eliminating cancer-causing chemicals from the colon.

              The fresh fruit has small but significant amounts of vitamin-A, and flavonoid pigments such as carotene-ß, xanthin, lutein, and cryptoxanthin-ß. Together, these compounds play vital roles in antioxidant and vision functions.

              Vitamin-A also required for maintaining the integrity of mucosa and skin. Consumption of natural fruits rich in vitamin-A and carotenes has been found to protect from lung and oral cavity cancers.

              Jackfruit is a good source of antioxidant vitamin-C, provides about 13.7 mg or 23% of RDA. Consumption of foods rich in vitamin-C helps the body develop resistance against infectious agents and scavenge harmful free radicals.

              It is one of the rare fruits that is rich in a B-complex group of vitamins. It contains outstanding amounts of vitamin B-6 (pyridoxine), niacin, riboflavin, and folic acid.

              Further, fresh fruit is a good source of potassium, magnesium, manganese, and iron. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids that helps controlling heart rate and blood pressure.

          Jackfruit seeds are indeed very rich in digestible starch, protein, and minerals. In general, the seeds are gathered from the ripe fruit during summer, sun-dried and stored for use during the rainy season in many parts of South-Indian states. Again, in these areas, jackfruit seeds can be employed in a variety of recipes where they are eaten either by roasting as a snack or added to stews (curries) in place of lentils.

          Jujube, also known as Chinese red date (枣), is an attractive "drupe" fruit of Chinese origin. "Zao" as the fruit recognized in the mainland China, it grows in natural wild and cultivated orchards in Korea, Japan, and many Middle Eastern regions. Dry jujube has similar taste and nutrition profile as that of dates; packed with energy, minerals, and essential vitamins.

          Botanically, it belongs to the Rhamnaceae (Buckthorn) family of flowering plants.

          Jujube is a small to medium sized, spreading deciduous tree reaching to a height of about 5-7 meters. Its highly branched twigs carry sharp spines. The plant is drought tolerant and can thrive well under poor soil conditions.

          Z. jujuba bears light green to white color flowers in early summer. Small size fruits cover the entire plant by July. Each fruit is "drupe" featuring creamy white flesh surrounding a single central hard seed as in apricots.

          Jujube comes in several different sizes and shapes depending upon the cultivar type. Each berry is about the size of 3-6 cm in diameter ranging in shape from oval, oblate, round to elongated and cylindrical. Inside, its slightly sticky, crispy textured pulp has apple-like sweet and tart taste in case of raw, green fruits. As the berry dries on the tree, its color turns from light green to red or brown. Completely mature fruit develops wrinkles on its surface as in dates. Fruits can be harvested on the basis of consumer demand, whether to enjoy crunchy light green berries or dried red ones.

          Health benefits of Jujube

              Jujube, fresh or dried, has long been considered as nutritious fruits praised in Chinese culture. The berries packed with an impressive list of essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals that are required for healthy growth, development and overall well-being.

              While fresh jujube plentiful in vitamins and fiber; dried, red ripe berries high in calories, rather concentrated sources of vitamins and minerals.

              They contain health benefiting tannins. Tannins are known to possess anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, and anti-hemorrhagic (prevent easy-bleeding tendencies) properties.

              Fresh jujube is one of the excellent sources of vitamin-C, composing about 69 mg per 100 grams or 115% of daily recommended intake. Vitamin-C is one of the powerful water-soluble antioxidants that help stave off harmful free radicals from the human body. It helps in the synthesis of connective tissue and wound repair.

              Dried jujube fruits are an excellent source of calcium (79 mg or 8% of RDI), iron 1.90 mg/100 g of fresh fruit (about 24% of RDI). Iron, being a component of hemoglobin inside the red blood cells, determines the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Calcium is an important mineral that is an essential constituent of bone and teeth and required by the body for muscle contraction, blood clotting, and nerve impulse conduction.

              Further, fresh as well as dried berries carry modest levels of the B-complex group of vitamins. Dried jujube contains very good amounts of pyridoxine (vitamin B-6), thiamin niacin, pantothenic acid, and riboflavin. These vitamins are acting as cofactors help the body metabolize carbohydrates, protein, and fats.

          Medicinal uses of Jujube

          Dry jujube fruits and its powder used in many traditional Chinese medicine to cure nervousness, stave off infections, and to improve digestive power.

          Persimmon fruit is a golden yellow, round or oval, flavorful, smooth textured delicacy of the Far East-Asian origin. Its sweet, delicious flesh is packed with much health promoting nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants vital for optimum health.

          Botanically, persimmons belong to the family of Ebenaceae, in the genus: Diospyros. This delicate fruit is native to China. From China, it spread to the Korean peninsula and Japan a very long time ago and later was introduced to California during the middle of the 19th century.

          Persimmons are either multi-trunked or single-stemmed deciduous trees, which may grow up to 25 ft in height. They grow best in areas where winters are moderate and summers relatively mild.

          Persimmon trees classified broadly into two general categories: those that bear "astringent fruit" (while unripe) and those that bear "non-astringent" fruits. An astringent cultivar, which is commonly cultivated in Japan known as “Hachiya,” is high in tannins and must be allowed to ripen completely on the tree itself until it attains jelly-soft consistency before accepted to be fit for consumption. A non-astringent persimmon, on the other hand, contains less tannin and can be eaten while it is crispy, as in apples. Astringency can be removed by treating the fruit with carbon dioxide or alcohol.

          During each season, persimmon tree bears many fruits that vary by cultivar from spherical to heart to flatten or squash-like in shape. They also greatly vary in size from as little as a few ounces to more than a pound. The color of the fruit ranges from light yellow-orange to dark orange-red. The entire fruit is edible except for the seed and calyx.

          Astringent varieties: Eureka, Hachiya, Saijo, Tamopan, Tanenashi, Triumph, etc.

          Non-astringent varieties: Fuyu (Fuyugaki), Gosho/Giant Fuyu/O'Gosho, Imoto, Izu, Jiro, Maekawajiro, Okugosho, Suruga, etc.

          Health benefits of persimmon fruit

              Persimmon fruit is moderately high in calories (provides 70 calories/100 g) but very low in fats. Its smooth textured flesh is a very good source of dietary fiber. 100 g of fresh fruit holds 3.6 g or 9.5% of recommended daily intake of soluble and insoluble fiber.

              Persimmons contain health benefiting flavonoid polyphenolic antioxidants such as catechins and gallocatechin in addition to having an important anti-tumor compound, betulinic acid. Catechins found to have anti-infective, anti-inflammatory and anti-hemorrhagic (prevents bleeding from small blood vessels) properties.

              Some of other antioxidant compounds found abundantly in this fruit are vitamin-A, β-carotene, lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin and cryptoxanthin. Together, these compounds work as protective scavengers against oxygen-derived free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that play a role in aging and various disease processes.

              Zeaxanthin, an important dietary carotenoid, is selectively absorbed into the retinal macula lutea in the eyes where it thought to provide antioxidant and protective light-filtering functions. It, thus, helps prevent "Age-related macular related macular disease"(ARMD) in the elderly.

              Persimmons are also a very good source of vitamin-C, another powerful antioxidant (especially native Chinese and American persimmons; provide 80% of DRI). Regular consumption of foods rich in vitamin-C helps the body develop resistance against infectious agents and scavenge harmful, pro-inflammatory free radicals.

              It is good in many valuable B-complex vitamins such as folic acid, pyridoxine (vitamin B-6), thiamin, etc. These vitamins act as co-factors for numerous metabolic enzymatic functions in the body.

              Fresh and dry Persimmon fruits also contain healthy amounts of minerals like potassium, manganese (15% of DRI), copper (12% of DRI), and phosphorus. Manganese is a co-factor for the enzyme, superoxide dismutase, which is a very powerful free radical scavenger. Copper is a co-factor for many vital enzymes, including cytochrome c-oxidase and superoxide dismutase (other minerals function as cofactors for this enzyme are manganese and zinc). Copper also required for the production of red blood cells.

          Kiwi fruit, also known as Chinese gooseberry, is one of the delicious fruits with full of promising health promoting phytochemicals, vitamins, and minerals. This widely recognized, wonderfully unique fruit is native to the Eastern Chinese "Shaanxi" province. And for the same reason, this exotic fruit is known as the national fruit of China.

          Kiwifruit plant is a semitropical, deciduous, large woody vine belonging to the family of Actinidiaceae in the Genus, Actinidia.

          The journey of this humble gooseberry from mainland China to Oceania, and thence to across the world is quite exciting! During the early years of twentieth-century, kiwifruit seeds were carried by the missionaries to New Zealand where it has become naturalized plant. From New Zealand, it spread to all over the world and now grown on a commercial scale in Europe and as far as California.

          During each season which lasts from September until November, the kiwi vine bears many oval shaped, fuzzy, brown colored fruits. Each kiwi berry measures approximately a large size hen’s egg and weighs up to 125 g. Internally; its emerald-green flesh is soft, lush, embedded with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. Its texture is similar to strawberry or sapodilla, and the flavor resembles a blend of strawberry and pineapple fruits.

          Apart from the typical green kiwifruit variety, several other cultivars were also grown in the orchards. "Hardy kiwifruit" (A. arguta) also known as the baby kiwi, is smaller than "Fuzzy kiwifruit" (A. deliciosa). Its size can be compared to that of a large grape, with smooth, edible, green skin. Inside, the "hardy kiwi fruit" resembles "fuzzy kiwi-fruit" in color, texture, but possess rather more intense flavor and sweetness. "Golden Kiwifruit," developed by the hybrid technique by the agricultural research department in New Zealand, has a smooth, sparse hairs, bronze skin, a pointed cap at one end and distinctive golden-yellow flesh with less tart and more tropical flavor than green kiwifruit. Commercially, it commands a higher market value than conventional green kiwifruit.

          Health benefits of Kiwi fruit

              Kiwifruit is moderately good in calories, comparable to that of grapes. 100 g of kiwi berry holds 61 calories. Nonetheless, it has many health-benefting antioxidants, minerals, vitamins, and fiber.

              It is a good source of soluble dietary fiber (3.8 g per 100 g of fruit OR 10% of RDA), which brand it as a good bulk laxative. The dietary fiber helps to protect the colon mucosa by decreasing exposure time to toxins as well as binding to cancer-causing chemicals in the colon.

              The fruit is an excellent source of antioxidant vitamin-C; providing about 154% of the DRI (daily-recommended intake). Consumption of foods rich in vitamin-C helps the body develop resistance against infectious agents and scavenge harmful free radicals.

              Kiwi fruit contains very healthy levels of vitamin-A, vitamin-E, vitamin-K and flavonoid antioxidants such as β-carotene, lutein, and xanthins. Vitamin-K has a potential role in the bone mass building by promoting osteoblastic activity in the bone. It also has established a role in Alzheimer's disease patients by limiting neuronal damage in the brain. Total antioxidant strength measured regarding oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) of kiwifruit (gold, raw) is 1210 µmol TE/100 g.

              Research studies suggest that certain chemical substances in kiwi-fruit functions as blood thinner function similar to aspirin; thus, it helps prevent clot formation inside the blood vessels and protect them from stroke and heart-attack risk.

              Kiwi-fruit seeds are an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids. Research studies show that consumption of foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and help prevent the development of ADHD, autism, and other developmental disorders in children.

              Fresh kiwi fruit is a very rich source of heart-healthy electrolyte "potassium." 100 g contains 312 mg or 7% of daily recommended levels of this electrolyte. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids that help regulate heart rate and blood pressure by countering malefic effects of sodium.

              It also contains good amounts of minerals like manganese, copper, iron, and magnesium. Manganese used in the human body as a co-factor for the powerful antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase. Magnesium is an important bone-strengthening mineral like calcium.

          Delicious, sweet yet tangy, kumquat fruit (cumquat, as the fruit generally recognized in Europe) is a winter/spring seasonal citrus fruits. Botanically, they belong to the Rutaceae family, in the genus, Fortunella, and named so after the botanist Robert Fortune, who brought them from China to Europe in the middle of the 19th century.

          Although kumquats taste just like that of other citrus category fruits, they are distinguished in a way that they can be eaten completely including the peel.

          Kumquats are a small sized evergreen tree native to South-Eastern parts of mountainous China. Today, they gew for their delicious fruits and as an ornamental tree in many regions of the world, including the USA.

          A mature kumquat tree bears several hundred olive-sized, brilliant orange color fruits in the winter. On the Interior, the fruit resembles tiny juicy orange-like segments (arils), firmly adhering to each other and with the peel. The pulp has 1-2 seeds placed centrally. The seeds are bitter in taste as in oranges, and generally, spit out.
          
          There exist several cultivars of kumquat; however, only four of them grown widely for their fruits.

              Nagami kumquat (Fortunella margarita): The fruit is oval and is the most common variety grown inside USA. It features smooth, light yellow peel and has tart flavor.

              Marumi kumquat (Fortunella japonica): The fruit is round, and has distinctive sweet taste and pleasant flavor.

              Meiwa kumquat (Fortunella crassifolia): It is round and larger than other verities. It is popular in Japan by name ninpo or neiha kinkan.

              Hong Kong Wild (Fortunella hindsii): They are the smallest sized kumquats.

          Health benefits of kumquat fruit

              Kumquat has a calorific value equivalent to that of grapes. 100 g of fresh fruits provide only 71 calories. Nonetheless, they are one of the incredible sources of health-benefiting phytonutrients such as dietary fiber, minerals, vitamins, and pigment antioxidants that contribute immensely to overall wellness.

              Kumquat is eaten along with its peel, a unique feature that differentiates it from other citrus family fruits. Its peel is rich in many essential oils, antioxidants, and fiber. 100 g whole kumquats provide 6.7 g or 17% of daily recommended levels of fiber that is composed of tannins, pectin, hemicellulose, and other non-starch polysaccharides (NSP).

              Fresh kumquats are packed with numerous health benefiting polyphenolic flavonoid anti-oxidants such as carotenes, lutein, zeaxanthin, tannins, etc. Kumquat peel composes many important essential oils, including limonene, pinene, α-bergamotene, caryophyllene, α-humulene, and α-murolene. Together, these compounds impart unique citrus aroma to the fruit.

              Further, fresh fruits contain adequate levels of some of the antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin A, C, and E. Altogether, these phytochemical compounds in kumquat fruit help scavenge harmful oxygen-derived free radicals from the human body and thereby protect us from cancers, diabetes, degenerative diseases, and infections.

              As in oranges, kumquats also very rich in vitamin-C. 100 g fruit provides 47.9 or 73% of RDA (Recommended daily allowances). Vitamin-C is one of the powerful natural antioxidant which has many essential biological roles to play such as collagen synthesis and wound healing. This vitamin has antiviral and anti-cancer activities, and helps prevent neurodegenerative diseases, arthritis, diabetes, etc by removing oxidant free-radicals from the body. Furthermore, vitamin-C felicitates iron absorption in the food.

              Kumquat has good levels of the B-complex group of vitamins such as thiamin, niacin, pyridoxine, folates, and pantothenic acid. These vitamins function as co-factors for metabolism of carbohydrates, protein, and fats.

              Further, kumquats are a modest source of minerals like calcium, copper, potassium, manganese, iron, selenium, and zinc. Calicum is the chief element required for bone and teeth formation. Copper needed in the production of red blood cells. Iron required for red blood cell formation as well for cellular oxidation.

            Juicy, acidic, yet flavorful, lemon is one of the most widely used citrus fruits worldwide. Lime, a close relative, is comparatively smaller and possesses thinner skin.

            Botanically, this citrus fruit belongs to the family of Rutaceae, in the genus, Citrus (which also includes orange, pomelo, tangerine, and grapefruit). Scientific name: Citrus limon. Lemon and limes are the small-sized citrus fruits. Nevertheless, both hold much more health benefiting constituents than other larger citrus family fruits such as oranges, yuzu, pomelo (Citrus maxima), etc.

            Lemons are thought to have originated in the Himalayan foothills of North-East India, and from where they spread all across the Middle East, Europe, Africa, and as far as Americas. Limes are smaller in size and less sour in taste than lemons. Put together, both of these tiny fruits are perhaps now the largest consumable among fruits all over the world.

            Likewise in other citrus plants, lemons also are small, spreading, evergreen trees, growing up to 10-12 feet in most cultivated plantations. They flourish well in temperate and tropical environments, whereas, cold and frosty conditions would affect their growth adversely. Stems and branches often armed with sharp, stout thorns. The fully-grown plant bears fragrant, white flowers in short cymes.

            Fruits belonging to the citrus group described as “hesperidium," (A hesperidium is a scientific term to describe the fruit structure belonging to the citrus group. In fact, the fruit is a modified berry with tough, leathery rind. Lemon's peel contains many volatile oil glands in pits. Interior flesh is composed of segments, called carpels, made up of numerous juice-filled vesicles that are specialized hair cells). Mature lemons turn yellow from green, measure about 5-8 cm in diameter, and weigh about 50- 80 g in weight.

            Health benefits of lemon

                Lemons are packed with numerous health benefiting nutrients. The fruit is less in calories, carrying just 29 calories per 100 g, the value being one of the lowest for the citrus fruits group.

                They contain zero saturated fats or cholesterol. Nonetheless are an excellent source of dietary fiber (7.36% of RDA). Lemon is one of the very low glycemic fruits.

                lemon's acidic taste is because of citric acid. Citric acid constitutes up to 8% in its juice. Citric acid is a natural preservative, aids in smooth digestion, and helps dissolve kidney stones.

                Lemons, like other fellow citrus fruits, are an excellent source of vitamin-C (ascorbic acid); provides about 88% of daily recommended intake. Ascorbic acid is a potent water-soluble natural anti-oxidant. This vitamin is helpful in preventing scurvy. Besides, consumption of foods rich in vitamin-C helps the human body develop resistance against infectious agents and scavenge harmful, pro-inflammatory free radicals from the blood.

                Lemons, like oranges, contain a variety of phytochemicals. Hesperetin, naringin, and naringenin are flavonoid glycosides commonly found in citrus fruits. Naringenin is found to have a bioactive effect on human health as antioxidant, free radical scavenger, anti-inflammatory, and immune system modulator. This substance has also been shown to reduce oxidant injury to DNA in the cells in-vitro studies.

                Additionally, they also compose a minute levels of vitamin A, and other flavonoid antioxidants such as α, and ß-carotenes, ß-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin, and lutein. These compounds are known to have antioxidant properties. Vitamin A also required for maintaining healthy mucosa and skin and is also essential for vision. Consumption of natural fruits rich in flavonoids helps the body to protect from lung and oral cavity cancers.

                Total ORAC value, which measures the antioxidant strength of 100 g of fresh lemon juice is 1225 µmol TE (Trolox equivalents).

                The fruit is also a good source of B-complex vitamins such as pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, and folates. These essential in the sense that body requires them from external sources to replenish.

                Further, they carry a healthy amount of minerals like iron, copper, potassium, and calcium. Potassium in an important component of cell and body fluids helps control heart rate and blood pressure.

            Citrus fruits, as such, have long been valued for their wholesome nutritious and antioxidant properties. It is a scientific fact that citrus fruits, especially lemons and oranges, by their richness in vitamins and minerals, have many proven health benefits. Moreover, it is now beginning to be appreciated that the other biologically active, non-nutrient compounds found in citrus fruits such as phytochemical antioxidants, and soluble as well as the insoluble dietary fiber is helpful in reduction in the risk for cancers, many chronic diseases like arthritis, and from obesity and coronary heart diseases.

        Limes are small, round, greenish-yellow, intensely acidic citrus fruits. Lime is primarily used for its juice in the western world, and for preparing "condiment-pickle" in many Southeast Asian countries.

        Botanically, lime fruit is a member citrus Rutaceae family fruits; a broad family which also includes lemon, orange, pomelo, tangerine, and grapefruit).

        It is the smallest among citrus fruits; nevertheless, it holds more health-benefiting nutrient profile than other citrus counterparts like lemon, orange, etc.

        Lime is an evergreen, small tree. Its dark-green, glossy, thick leaves appear similar to lemons. Unlike lemons which prefer cool temperate climates, limes can flourish well under tropical, humid environments. In general, citrus trees can grow on a wide range of soil types ranging from sand to loam to heavy clay as long as they are well-drained.

        Generally, limes are smaller in size but more acidic than lemons. Their outer rind is green and glossy, bit thinner than lemons. The peel is turning to yellow at maturity. The pulp is light-green, with 6-15 segments, aromatic, juicy, and highly acidic arils. Each fruit measures about 1.5-2 inches across and weighs about 50 to 60 g.

        Common lime cultivars are:
            Key lime-It is the predominant lime cultivar inside the USA. They are small in size, feature thinner peel, and more tart and juicy than other cultivar types.

            Persian lime is a hybrid between Key lime and citron. It has oblong shape and almost seedless. It is larger than other lime varieties and has thicker rind.

        Health benefits of limes

            Limes carry almost the same amount of calories as lemons; 30 cal/100 g. They are one of the very low glycemic index fruits.

            Lime juice contains citric acid, an organic acid which gives sour taste. Citric acid constitutes about 5 mg per oz of its juice. Citric acid is a natural preservative, antioxidant, helps dissolve kidney stones and helps in smooth digestion.

            Limes carry moderate concentrations of vitamin-C on comparison to other citrus ategory fruits like oragnge and lemon. 100 g of fresh fruit contains 29.1 mg or 48.5% of daily avarage intake. Vitamin C is a natural water-soluble anti-oxidant. It helps in the prevention and cureof scurvy disease. Besides, consumption of fruits rich in vitamin-C helps the human body develop resistance against infectious agents and scavenge harmful, pro-inflammatory free radicals from the human body.

            Limes and lemons compose flavonoid glycoside phytochemicals such as hesperetin, naringin, and naringenin. Naringenin is found to have a bioactive effect on human health as antioxidant, free radical scavenger, anti-inflammatory, and immune system modulator. This substance has also been shown to reduce oxidant injury to DNA in the cells in-vitro studies.

            Limes carry relatively more vitamin-A content than lemons. Vitamin-A is a natural antioxidant which helps in the mucosa and skin integrity as well as acuity of vision. Consumption of natural fruits rich in vitamin-A and carotenoids helps the body to protect from lung and oral cavity cancers.

            They compose modest amounts of B-complex vitamins such as niacin, thiamin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, and folates. These essential in the sense that body requires them from external sources to replenish.

            Further, they carry a modest amounts of minerals like iron, copper, potassium, and calcium. Potassium in an important component of cell and body fluids helps control heart rate and blood pressure.

            The outer peel of lime fruit composes aromatic essential oils. The oil is used in the food and pharmaceutical industry for its preservative, anti-viral and antioxidant properties.

        Citrus fruits have long been valued for their wholesome nutritious and antioxidant properties. Citrus fruits, especially lime, lemons and oranges, have many scientifically proven health benefits in terms of disease prevention; for example- urinary tract stones, arthritis and scurvy.

        Litchi has a sweet taste and fragrant flavor that everyone from children to elderly is looking forward to savoring! Its flesh envelopes around a single, glossy, brown seed, 2 cm long, and 1–1.5 cm in diameter. The seeds, like that in the case of sapodilla,, are not poisonous but should not be eaten. Fresh lychees can be readily available in the markets from May to October, about 120-140 days after flowering.

        Health benefits of Lychee

            Lychee fruit contains 66 calories per 100 g, comparable to that in the table grapes. It has no saturated fats or cholesterol but composes of good amounts of dietary fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants.

            Research studies suggest that Oligonol, a low molecular weight polyphenol, is found abundantly in lychee fruit. Oligonol is thought to have antioxidant and anti-influenza virus actions. Also, it helps improve blood flow to organs, reduce weight, and protect skin from harmful UV rays. (Takuya Sakurai (Kyorin University, Japan), Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem., 72(2), 463-476, 2008).

            Litchi, like citrus fruits, is an excellent source of vitamin-C; 100 g fresh fruits provide 71.5 mg or 119% of daily recommended value. Studies suggest that consumption of fruits rich in vitamin-C helps human body develop resistance against infectious agents and scavenge harmful, pro-inflammatory free radicals.

            Further, it is a very good source of B-complex vitamins such as thiamin, niacin, and folates. These vitamins are essential since they function by acting as co-factors to help the body metabolize carbohydrates, protein, and fats.

            Litchi also carries many minerals like potassium and copper. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids help control heart rate and blood pressure; thus, it offers protection against stroke and coronary heart diseases. Copper required in the production of red blood cells.

Botanically, this exotic fruit belongs to the family of Anacardiaceae, a family that also includes numerous species of tropical fruiting trees in the flowering plants such as cashew, pistachio.

          Mango is a tropical tree cultivated in many regions of India, and now its farming has been extended wide across the world in many continents.After flowering, its fruits grow at the end of a long, string-like peduncle, with sometimes more than one fruit to a peduncle.

          Each fruit measures 5 to 15 cms in length and about 4 to 10 cms in width, and has typical “mango” shape, or sometimes oval or round. Its weight ranges from 150 g to around 750 g. Outer skin (pericarp) is smooth and is green in un-ripe mangoes but turns in ripe fruits into golden yellow, crimson red, yellow or orange-red depending upon the cultivar type. Fresh mango season lasts from April until August.

          Mango comes in different shapes and sizes depending upon cultivar types. Internally, its flesh (mesocarp) is juicy, orange-yellow in color with numerous soft fibrils radiating from its centrally placed flat, oval-shaped stone (enveloping a single large kidney-shaped seed). Its flavor is pleasant and rich and tastes sweet with a mild tartness. A high-quality mango fruit should feature no or very less fiber composition and minimal tartness. Mango seed (stone) may either has a single embryo or sometimes polyembryonic.

          Health benefits of Mango fruit

              Mango fruit is rich in pre-biotic dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals, and poly-phenolic flavonoid antioxidant compounds.

              According to new research study, mango fruit has been found to protect from colon, breast, leukemia and prostate cancers. Several trial studies suggest that polyphenolic antioxidant compounds in mango are known to offer protection against breast and colon cancers.

              Mango fruit is an excellent source of Vitamin-A and flavonoids like β-carotene, α-carotene, and β-cryptoxanthin. 100 g of fresh fruit provides 180 IU (54 μg) or 6% of recommended daily levels of vitamin-A. Together; these compounds have been known to have antioxidant properties and are essential for vision.

              Vitamin-A also required for maintaining healthy mucosa and skin. Consumption of natural fruits rich in carotenes is known to protect from lung and oral cavity cancers.

          Delicious and widely popular peaches are native to China, from where they spread to rest of the world via ancient silk route. Peach fruits belong to the genus Prunus; in the family of Rosaceae.

          Technically, peach fruit is a "drupe" having similar features as that of other Prunus members including plums, nectarine, almonds, and damson.

          The peach plant is described as a small, deciduous tree that grows up to 25 to 30 feet tall, and widely grown in the United States, Europe, and China for its juicy fruits. There are several cultivars of peach grown all over the world which differ in their color, size and growing characteristics based upon their regions of origin.

          Every year, a peach tree blossoms in the spring. In general, each peach tree bears many, almost uniform sized fruits between May and September months. Its fruit is about the size of a small apple, measuring about 7-10 cm in diameter and weigh about 130-160 grams. Its fuzzy outer surface features longitudinal furrows extending from its stem end to the tip. Depending on the pit that is free or firmly attached to the pulp, they are classified into freestone or clinging stone varieties.

          Donut peach or Saturn peaches, (Prunus persica var. platycarpais) a flattened disc-like freestone fruit drawn inward like a disc at its center. They have white flesh and similar peach flavor and taste.

          Internally, the flesh is soft, juicy, sweet and tart with a pleasant fruity aroma. Depending on the variety, its flesh may feature white to creamy-yellow color with a centrally placed single pit. The stone encloses an almond or apricot like kernel inside the hard shell (pit). The kernels can be edible only in small quantities.

          Health Benefits of Peaches

              Wonderfully delicious peaches are low in calories (100 g just provide 39 calories) and contain no saturated fats. Nonetheless, they are packed with numerous health promoting compounds, minerals, and vitamins.

              The total measured antioxidant strength (ORAC value) of 100 g peach fruit is 1814 TE (Trolox equivalents).

              Fresh peaches are a moderate source of antioxidant, vitamin-C. Vitamin-C has antioxidant effects and is required for connective tissue synthesis inside the human body. Consumption of foods rich in vitamin-C helps develop resistance against infectious agents, and help scavenges harmful free radicals.

              Fresh fruits are also a small source of vitamin-A and ß-carotene. ß-carotene is a pro-vitamin, which converts into vitamin-A inside the body. Vitamin-A is essential for night vision. It is also essential for maintaining healthy mucus membranes and skin. Consumption of natural fruits rich in vitamin-A is known to offer protection from lung and oral cavity cancers.

              They are rich in many vital minerals such as potassium, fluoride, and iron. Iron is required for red blood cell formation. Fluoride is a component of bones and teeth and is essential for prevention of dental caries. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids that help regulate heart rate and blood pressure.

              Peaches contain health promoting flavonoid poly phenolic antioxidants such as lutein, zeaxanthin, and ß-cryptoxanthin. These compounds help act as protective scavengers against oxygen-derived free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that play a role in aging and various disease processes.

          Sweet, delicious and rich flavored pears offer crunchiness of apples yet juicy as peach and nectarine. They are widely popular, particularly in the whole of the northern hemisphere, for their unique nutrient qualities.

          Botanically, it is a "pome fruit” produced in the Rosaceae family of trees, in the Pyrus genus. Pome fruit plants are average sized trees found in semi-tropical regions around the northern hemisphere. They bear medium-size fruits that characteristically have several small seeds at its center encased in a tough capsule. The members of pome family fruits include apple, loquat, quince, medlar, etc.

          Pears are broadly classified based on their place of origin as Asian-pears and European-pears. Asian varieties feature crispy texture and firm consistency that do not change even after harvesting or storage, making them fit for ready-to-eat. Whereas, European types generally become soft and juicy when allowed them to ripen.

          In structure, pear fruit feature bell or “pyriform” shape; around 5-6 inches long, and weigh about 200 gm. Fresh fruit is firm in texture with mild ‘apple’ flavor. Externally, its skin is very thin; and depending upon the cultivar type, it can be green, red-orange or yellow-orange in color. Inside, its off-white color flesh is soft and juicy. However, in the case of completely ripe fruits, its flesh may turn to grainy texture with gritty sensation while cutting with a knife. The center of the fruit is more or less similar to an apple in appearance with centrally located tiny inedible seeds.

              Some of the popular Asian varieties are Ichiban Nashi, Shinsui, Shinseki, and Nijisseki.

              Popular European types are Bartlett and Comice.

          Health benefits of pears

              Pears fruit is packed with health benefiting nutrients such as dietary fiber, antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins, which are necessary for optimum health. Total measured antioxidant strength (ORAC value) in pears is 2941 µmol TE/100 g.

              Pears are a good source of dietary fiber. 100 g fruit provides 3.1 g or 8% of fiber per 100 g. Regular eating of this fruit may offer protection against colon cancer. Most of the fiber in them is a non-soluble polysaccharide (NSP), which functions as a good bulk laxative in the gut. Additionally, its gritty fiber content binds to cancer-causing toxins and chemicals in the colon, protecting its mucous membrane from contact with these compounds.

              Also, pear fruit is one of the very low-calorie fruits; provides just 58 calories per 100g. A low calorie but high fiber diet may help bring significant reduction in body weight, and blood LDL cholesterol levels.

              They contain good quantities of vitamin-C. Fresh fruits provide about 7% of RDA per 100 g of this vitamin.

              They are a modest sources of antioxidant flavonoid phytonutrients such as β-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin. These compounds, along with vitamin C and A, help the body protected from harmful free radicals.

              The fruit is a good source of minerals such as copper, iron, potassium, manganese and magnesium as well as B-complex vitamins such as folates, riboflavin and pyridoxine (vitamin B-6).

              Although not well documented, pears are among the least allergenic of all the fruits. For the same reason, they often recommended by health practitioners as a safe alternative in the preparation of food products in allergic persons.

          One of the most prized and popular fruits, pineapple or "ananas" has an interesting history to narrate. Originally indigenous to local Paraguayans in South America, it spread from its native land by the local Indians up through the South and Central Americas and to the West Indies. Later, it was brought to Spain when Columbus discovered Americas’ in 1493. In the 15th and 16th centuries, it spread to rest of the world by the European sailors (just like tomatoes) who carried it along with them to protect themselves from scurvy, a disease caused by the deficiency of vitamin-C.

          Scientifically, it is known as Ananas comosus and belongs to the family of Bromeliaceae, in the genus; Ananas.

          Pineapple is a tropical, perennial, drought-tolerant plant. It reaches up to 5-8 ft in height and spreads around about 3-4 feet radius cover. It is essentially a short, stout stem with a rosette of waxy long, needle-tipped leaves.

          The plant bears several long, oval to cylindrical fruits during each season from March until June.

          Botanically, the A. comosus described as a compound (multiple) fruit that develops from many small fruitlets fused together around a central core. Its pulp is juicy and fleshy with the stem serving as a supporting fibrous core. The outer skin features rough, tough, and scaly rind. The color in the ripe fruits may be yellow, orange-yellow or reddish. Internally, its juicy flesh may range from creamy white to yellow and has a mix of sweet and tart taste with rich flavor. Each fruit measures up to 12 inches in length and weighs 1 to 8 pounds or more.

          Health benefits of Pineapple fruit

              Fresh pineapple is low in calories. Nonetheless, it is a storehouse for several unique health promoting compounds, minerals, and vitamins that are essential for optimum health.

              100 g fruit provides just about 50 calories; equivalent to that of apples. Its flesh contains no saturated fats or cholesterol. Nonetheless, it is a rich source of soluble and insoluble dietary fiber like pectin.

              Pineapple fruit contains a proteolytic enzyme bromelain that digests food by breaking down protein. Bromelain also has anti-inflammatory, anti-clotting and anti-cancer properties. Studies have shown that consumption of pineapple regularly helps fight against arthritis, indigestion and worm infestation.

              Fresh pineapple is an excellent source of antioxidant vitamin; vitamin-C. 100 g fruit contains 47.8 or 80% of this vitamin. Vitamin-C required for the collagen synthesis in the body. Collagen is the main structural protein in the body required for maintaining the integrity of blood vessels, skin, organs, and bones. Regular consumption of foods rich in vitamin-C helps the body protect from scurvy; develop resistance to combat infectious agents (boosts immunity) and scavenge harmful, pro-inflammatory free radicals from the body.

              It also contains small amount Vitamin-A (provides 58 IU per 100 g) and β -carotene levels. These compounds are known to have antioxidant properties. Vitamin-A is also required maintaining healthy mucosa, skin, and is essential for vision. Studies suggest that consumption of natural fruits rich in flavonoids helps the human body to protect from lung and oral cavity cancers.

              Further, ananas fruit is rich in the B-complex group of vitamins like folates, thiamin, pyridoxine, riboflavin and minerals like copper, manganese, and potassium. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids, helps controlling heart rate and blood pressure. Copper is an essential cofactor for red blood cell synthesis. Manganese is a co-factor for the enzyme superoxide dismutase, which is a very powerful free radical scavenger.

          Binomially, quince is the only fruiting tree in the genus: Cydonia.

          Quinces are medium sized semi-tropical deciduous trees, reaching about 10 to 15 feet in height. Pink-white flowers appear in the spring and early summer, which develop into pear-shaped, golden color fruits. The fruit is larger than medium apple and bumpy; look somewhat like giant guava, avocado, or as short-necked pear fruit. Its fuzzy surface is smooth as in peaches.

          Quince fruit weighs about 250-750 g or more in some varieties. Inside, its flesh is light yellow, gritty and has many seeds concentrated at its center as in apples. Raw quince has an intense fruity aroma and together with its bright yellow color instantly attracts the fruit lover’s attention. However, raw fruits, even after ripe, generally astringent and tart.

          Health benefits of quince

              Quince is low-calorie fruit. 100 g fresh raw fruit provides 57 calories. Besides, it composes several vital poly-phenolic antioxidants than apples and pears. The fruit is a storehouse of phytonutrients such as dietary fiber, minerals, and vitamins.

              Quince flesh along with its peel contains good amounts of fiber. Further, its gritty granules in the pulp composed of astringent compounds known as tannins namely, catechin and epicatechin.

          Wonderfully delicious, bright red raspberry is among the most popular berries to relish! They are rich sources of health-promoting plant-derived chemicals, minerals, and vitamins that are essential for optimum health.

          Botanically, raspberry is a small shrub belonging to the family of Rosaceae, of the genus; Rubus. It is native to the Europe but today widely cultivated in many temperate regions all over the world under supervised farms. Poland, United States, Germany, and Chile are some of the prominent growing areas of raspberries.

          Several different sub-species of raspberries exist. However, the most popular commercial cultivar in practice is, red-raspberry, which is the result of hybridization between R. idaeus (European raspberry) and R. strigosus (American raspberry) types.

          Technically, the whole berry is an aggregate of small "drupe" fruits, arranged in circular fashion around a hollow, central cavity. Each little drupelet composes of juicy pulp with a single, tiny white-yellow seed. Raspberries have a taste that varies by cultivar that ranges from sweet to acidic; a feature that is quite similar to strawberries.

          Raspberry has a conical shape, weighs about 2-4 g and contains 80-100 drupelets arranged in concentric whorls. While the most common type of raspberry (Rubus idaeus) is red-pink in color, several hybrids come in a range of colors including black, purple, orange, yellow and white (colorless).

          Health benefits of raspberries

              Delicious raspberries are low in calories and fats. Nonetheless, they are a rich source of dietary fiber and antioxidants. 100 g berries hold just 52 calories but provide 6.5 g of fiber (16% of daily recommended intake).

              Raspberries have significantly high levels of phenolic flavonoid phytochemicals such as anthocyanins, ellagic acid (tannin), quercetin, gallic acid, cyanidin, pelargonidin, catechins, kaempferol and salicylic acid. Scientific studies show that the antioxidant compounds in these berries play a potential role in the cure of cancer, aging, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases.

              Xylitol is a low-calorie sugar substitute extracted from raspberries. A teaspoonful of xylitol carries just 9.6 calories as compared to 15 calories of sugar. Xylitol absorbs into the blood more slowly in the intestines than simple sugar and does not contribute to high glycemic index. It thus can be helpful for people with diabetes to regulate wide fluctuations of blood sugar levels.

              Fresh raspberries are excellent sources of vitamin-C, which is also a powerful natural antioxidant. 100 g berries provide 26.2 mg, or about 47% of DRI of vitamin-C. Consumption of fruits rich in vitamin-C helps the human body develop resistance against infectious agents, counter inflammation, and scavenge harmful free-radicals.

              Raspberry contains anti-oxidant vitamins like vitamin-A and vitamin-E. In addition to the antioxidants mentioned above, it is also rich in several other health promoting flavonoid poly phenolic antioxidants such as lutein, zeaxanthin, and ß-carotene, albeit in small amounts. Altogether, these compounds help act as protective scavengers against oxygen-derived free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that play a role in aging and various disease processes.

              Raspberry has an ORAC value (oxygen radical absorbance capacity) of about 4900 µmol TE per 100 grams, crediting it among the top-ranked ORAC fruits.

              They contain a good amount of minerals like potassium, manganese, copper, iron and magnesium. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids that helps controlling heart rate and blood pressure. Manganese is utilized by the body as a co-factor for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase. Copper is essential in the production of red blood cells.

              They are rich in the B-complex group of vitamins and vitamin-K. The berries contain very good amounts of vitamin B-6, niacin, riboflavin, and folic acid. These vitamins function as co-factors and help the body in the metabolism of carbohydrates, protein, and fats.

          Star fruit, also known as carambola, is a star-shaped tropical fruit with sweet and sour flavor. Carambola is native to the Malayan peninsula and cultivated in many parts of Southeast Asia, Pacific Islands and China for its fruits. Although abundant and plentiful, carambola is yet to gain popularity, especially in the western world.

          The genus Averrhoa includes two well-known sorrels (Oxalidaceae) family of fruiting trees, carambola, and bilimbi (tree cucumber).

          The fruit is recognized as belimbing manis or balimbing (filipino) in many South-East Asian regions and kamrakh in India.

          Star fruit is a small, bushy evergreen tree that grows very well under hot, humid, tropical conditions. The plant bears small lilac colored, bell-shaped flowers in clusters which subsequently develop into oblong shaped fruits with characteristic five angled edges (sides or ribs) that appear like a starfish in cross sections. Both sweet and sour varieties begin to yield under cultivable orchards, and ready for harvesting when the plants reach about 3-4 years old.

          Carambola fruit features light-green to yellow with attractive smooth waxy surface and weighs about 70-130g. Inside, it's crispy, and juicy pulp can either be mildly sweet or extremely sour depending upon the cultivar type and amount of oxalic acid concentration. In some seed varieties, 2-5 tiny edible seeds found at the center of each angled cavity.

          Health benefits of star fruit

              Star fruit is one of the very low-calorie exotic fruits. 100 g fruit just provides 31 calories, which is much lower than for any other popular tropical fruits. Nonetheless, it has an impressive list of essential nutrients, antioxidants, and vitamins required for well-being.

              The fruit along with its waxy peel provides a good amount of dietary fiber. Fiber helps prevent absorption of dietary LDL-cholesterol in the gut. The dietary fibers also help protect the mucous membrane of the colon from exposure to toxic substances by binding to cancer-causing chemicals in the colon.

              Star fruit contains good quantities of vitamin-C. Vitamin-C is a powerful natural antioxidant. 100 g of fresh fruit provides 34.7 mg or 57% of daily required levels of vitamin-C. In general, consumption of fruits rich in vitamin-C helps the human body develop resistance against infectious agents and scavenge harmful, pro-inflammatory free radicals from the body.

              Star fruit is rich in antioxidant phytonutrient polyphenolic flavonoids. Some of the important flavonoids present are quercetin, epicatechin, and gallic acid. Total polyphenol contents (Folin assay) in this fruit is 143 mg/100 g. Altogether, these compounds help protect from deleterious effects of oxygen-derived free radicals by warding them off the body.

              Besides, it is a good source of B-complex vitamins such as folates, riboflavin, and pyridoxine (vitamin B-6). Together, these vitamins help as co-factors for enzymes in metabolism as well as in various synthetic functions inside the body.

              It also carries a small amount of minerals and electrolytes like potassium, phosphorus, and zinc and iron. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids helps controlling heart rate and blood pressure; thus, it counters bad influences of sodium.

          Medicinal uses

              Starfruit and its juice are often recommended in many folk medicines in Brazil as a diuretic (to increase urine output), expectorant, and to suppress a cough. (Medical disclaimer).

            Delicious, rich-red, sweet, yet gently tangy strawberries are among the most popular berries. These berries are native to Europe, however, nowadays cultivated in many temperate regions all over the world as important commercial crops. Botanically, the plant is a low-growing runner (creeper) belonging to the family of Rosaceae, in the genus: Fragaria.

            In the botany, strawberry described as an aggregate fruit, wherein many one-seeded achenes are coming together to form a large fleshy receptacle. It is a small, low-lying, spreading shrub. It bears small white flowers which eventually develop into small conical, light green, immature fruits. They turn red upon maturity with each berry featuring red pulp with tiny, yellow color seeds piercing from within through its surface. Its top end carries a green leafy cap (calyx with peduncle) that is adorning as a crown.

            Each berry features conical shape, weighs about 25 grams and measures about 3 cm in diameter. The berries have the taste that varies by cultivar type and ranges from quite sweet to acidic.

            Although wild varieties are sometimes available in the market, the large-scale production employs the modern "plasticulture" system. In this method, raised beds are formed each year, fumigated, and covered with plastic which prevents weed growth and crop spoiling.

            Health benefits of strawberries

                Strawberry is low in calories (32 cal/100 g) and fats but rich source of health-promoting phytonutrients, minerals, and vitamins that are essential for optimum health.

                Strawberries have significantly high amounts of phenolic flavonoid phytochemicals called anthocyanins and ellagic acid. Scientific studies show that consumption of these berries may have potential health benefits against cancer, aging, inflammation and neurological diseases.

                Strawberry has an ORAC value (oxygen radical absorbance capacity, a measure of antioxidant strength) of about 3577 μmol TE per 100 grams.

                Fresh berries are an excellent source of vitamin-C (100 g provide 58.8 mg or about 98% of RDI), which is also a powerful natural antioxidant. Consumption of fruits rich in vitamin-C helps the body develop resistance against infectious agents, counter inflammation and scavenge harmful free radicals.

                The fruit is rich in the B-complex group of vitamins. It contains good amounts of vitamin B-6, niacin, riboflavin, pantothenic acid and folic acid. These vitamins are acting as co-factors help the body metabolize carbohydrate, proteins, and fats.

                Strawberries contain vitamin-A, vitamin-E and health promoting flavonoid poly phenolic antioxidants such as lutein, zeaxanthin, and beta-carotene in small amounts. These compounds help act as protective scavengers against oxygen-derived free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that play a role in aging and various disease processes.

                Furthermore, They contain a good amount of minerals like potassium, manganese, fluorine, copper, iron and iodine. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids that helps controlling heart rate and blood pressure. The human body uses manganese as a co-factor for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase.

                Copper is required in the production of red blood cells. Iron is esential for red blood cell formation. Fluoride is a component of bones and teeth and offers protection from dental caries.

            Juicy, sweet and citric, tamarillo or tree tomato is a small oval-shaped fruit. It is closely related to other Solanaceae members of vegetables and fruits such as tomato, eggplant, tomatillo, groundcherry, and chili peppers.

            Some of the common names include tomate de arbol (Spanish), tomate de arvore (Brazil, Portuguese), and tree tomato (English).

            Tree tomatoes are thought to have originated in the semitropical high altitude Andes forests of Brazil and Peru. They are cultivated on a commercial scale in large orchards in northern parts of New Zealand and exported to USA, Australia, Japan and European Union countries.

            Tamarillo is a shrub or small size tree reaching about 5-15 feet in height with hairy stems and branches. Its evergreen leaves are broader than in tomato. A well-grown plant bears small fleshy pale-pink attractive flowers in the first year of plantation. However, fruiting generally discouraged until it reaches second or third year.

            Tamarillo fruit features an oval shape with smooth, shiny skin and can be of different colors depending upon the cultivar type. Red tamarillos are more common than orange-yellow varieties. Completely mature fruit features oval, about 6-8 cm in length and 4-6 cm in width, weighs about 100 grams.

            On the inside, cut section appears similar to that of in plum tomatoes. The flesh is juicy, deep, sweet yet tangy, flavorful, filled with many tiny, flat, disk-like edible seeds that are slightly larger than in tomatoes.

            Health benefits of Tamarillos

                Tamarillos are one of the very low-calorie fruits. 100 g of fresh fruit contain just 31 calories. They contain slightly more calories, fat, and protein than tomatoes. (100 g tomato has 18 calories). Nevertheless, they have good amounts of health benefiting plant nutrients such as dietary fiber (3.3 mg or 9% of RDA), minerals, antioxidants, and vitamins.

                Acidic flavor (sourness) of tree tomatoes mainly comes from citric acid. The other important acid in them is malic acid.

                The ORAC value (antioxidant strength) of 100 g fresh tamarillos is 1659 TE (Trolox equivalents). Their antioxidant value primarily derived from poly-phenolic, flavonol and anthocyanidin compounds. Some of these phytochemicals include chlorogenic acid, kaempferol, and anthocyanin pigments such as cyanidin glycosides, especially concentrated in their skin. Scientific studies suggest that Chlorogenic acid helps to decrease blood sugar levels in type-II diabetes mellitus.

                Yellow and gold variety tamarillo contains more vitamin-A and carotenes than red varieties. However, red variety has more anthocyanin pigments. In addition, yellow tamarillos are an excellent source of carotenes and xanthins. These compounds possess antioxidant properties and, together with vitamin-A, are essential for good visual health. Further, vitamin-A is also required for maintaining the integrity of mucosa and skin. Consumption of natural vegetables and fruits rich in flavonoids help protect from lung and oral cavity cancers.

                Tree tomato is a modest source of B-complex vitamins such as thiamin, riboflavin, and pyridoxine (vitamin B-6). Together, these vitamins help as cofactors for enzymes in metabolism as well as in various synthetic functions inside the body.

                They are indeed a very good source of electrolyte, potassium. 100 g fresh fruit has 321 mg or 7% of this mineral. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids helps controlling heart rate and blood pressure; thus, counters the bad influences of sodium. Also, the fruit contains a few minerals such as copper, manganese, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc and iron.

            Tangerines are a variety of citrus fruits and closely related to Oranges. They distinguished from oranges by their smaller size, loose, easily peelable skin (pericarp) and more sweeter juicy flesh (arils).

            They also known as mandarin oranges in Europe. In Japan, a closely related seedless variety of mandarins known as Unshu mikan or satsuma mandarin grown in abundance in Kagoshima prefecture. Just as in oranges, mandarins also belong to the Rutaceae (Citrus Family)

            Mandarin oranges thought to have originated in South-Eastern tropical forests of China. Today, it is widely grown in many parts of the world, as far as California, Philippines (Dalanghita) and South Africa (naartjie in Afrikaans) as an important commercial crop.

            Tangerine tree is smaller than orange, with slender branching and foliage-deep-green leaves with pointed ends. The fruit is flat, small compared to "Navel" or "Valencia" oranges. Its loose, deep-orange color skin (pericarp) can be peeled rather easily. Inside, it features extensive fibrous pith, which is loosely attached to the inner skin and edible arils. An average-sized fruit has 8-10 juicy segments (arils).

            Several hybrid varieties of tangerines exist:

            Tangelos, also known as honeybells, are a hybrid between tangerine and orange (Citrus sinensis) or grapefruit (Citrus paradisi). Tangelos, like tangerines, have loose skin and juicy sweet flavored segments. They are distinguished from oranges by a characteristic knob at the stem end of the fruit.

                Tangors (Citrus nobilis) are a cross between oranges (C. sinensis) and tangerine (C. reticulata). They feature large size, and sweet-tart flavor similar to oranges.

                Clementines, another member of the citrus family, are hybrid between a mandarin and sweet oranges. They are smaller, have smooth, glossy skin, and very sweet, juicy, almost seedless segments.

                Yuzu fruit or Japanese citrus fruit is a hybrid between C. ichngenesis and mandarin oranges (C. reticulata). They characteristically have intense lime-like fragrance and tart flavor.

            Health benefits of tangerines

                As in oranges, Tangerines too are very low (53 calories/100 g) in calories. Nevertheless, they are valuable sources of flavonoid antioxidants like naringenin, naringin, hesperetin, vitamin-A, carotenes, xanthins, and lutein; in fact, many times higher than in the oranges.

                Also, the citrus fruits are very rich sources of vitamin-C (ascorbic acid), a water-soluble vitamin. Vitamin-C is one of the powerful natural antioxidant, which play vital role in collagen synthesis, wound healing, antiviral, anti-cancer activity, and help prevent from neuro-degenerative diseases, arthritis, and cold/fever by removing oxidant-free radicals from the body. Vitamin-C helps in the absorption of iron in the food by reducing it from ferrous form to efficiently absorbing ferric form in the gut.

                Further, they contain natural soluble and insoluble fiber like hemicellulose, pectin...etc., which prevents cholesterol absorption in the gut. Adequate fiber in the food aids in smooth bowel movements by acting as a laxative.

                Citrus fruits, as such, have long been valued for their wholesome nutritious and antioxidant properties. It is a scientifically established fact that citrus fruits, especially oranges, by their richness in vitamins and minerals, have many proven health benefits. Moreover, nutritionists begin to appreciate the benefits of other biologically active, non-nutrient compounds in citrus fruits such as phytochemical antioxidants. Soluble and insoluble dietary fibers play a vital role in the reduction of risk factors for cancers, many chronic diseases like arthritis, and from obesity and coronary heart diseases.

          Do you wish to quench thirst while boosting your body with antioxidant lycopene and vitamin-A? Watermelon has everything you need to beat the scorching summer heat. Crunchy, delicious and juicy, they indeed are the great source of much-needed electrolytes and water to lessen summer temperatures.

          Botanically, the fruit belongs to the family of Cucurbitaceae, in the genus: Citrullus, and is related to the other same family members such as cantaloupe, squash, and pumpkin that run as vines on the soil. It is widely grown in many tropical countries where it is one of the major commercial fruit crops.

          Watermelon was originated from southern African countries, and from where it spread to rest of the tropical and subtropical regions. After a couple of weeks of seedling, the plant bears many yellow flowers that may require honeybees for pollination.

          Externally, the fruit features smooth, deep green to yellow, thick exterior rind with light-green or gray colored vertical stripes adorning its surface. Internally, the flesh is juicy and comes in different colors like pink, red, or yellow depending upon the cultivar type. Near its core, numerous small black seeds embed in the middle-third portion of the flesh.

          Watermelon has a neutral flavor, and its taste somewhat described as plain-sweet water (light sugar syrup). Its flesh is soft yet crunchy unlike soft, creamy texture of muskmelons.

          Varieties of watermelon fruits are being cultivated the world over, featuring variation in their size, shape, and flesh color (red, orange, and yellow). In Japan, the black-skinned Toma watermelons (densuke watermelon) are famous for their sweeter-than-usual taste in comparison to normal melons, and therefore, fetch higher prices.

          Health benefits of watermelon

            Rich in electrolytes and water content, melons are natural gift to beat tropical summer thirst.

              Watermelons are very low in calories (just 30 calories per 100 g) and carry negligible amounts of fats. Nonetheless, they plentiful in numerous health promoting phytonutrients and antioxidants essential for optimum health.

              Watermelon nutrition profile contains vitamin-A and lycopene, which are powerful natural antioxidants. 100 g fresh fruit provides 569 IU or 19% of daily-required levels of vitamin-A. It is one of the essential vitamins needed for healthy vision and immunity. Vitamin-A is also required for maintaining healthy mucosa and skin. Consumption of natural fruits rich in vitamin-A is known to protect from lung and oral cavity cancers.

              It is rich in antioxidant flavonoids like β-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and cryptoxanthin. These antioxidants have been found to offer protection against colon, prostate, breast, endometrial, lung, and pancreatic cancers. Phytochemicals present in watermelons like lycopene and carotenoids have the ability to help protect cells and other structures in the body from oxygen-free radicals.

              Watermelon is an excellent source of carotenoid pigment, lycopene and indeed, superior to raw red tomato. 100 g of fresh melon provides 4532 Âµg lycopene, whereas this value only 2573 Âµg for tomatoes. Studies suggest that lycopene offers protection to the skin against harmful UV rays.

              Watermelon fruit is a good source of potassium; Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids that helps controlling heart rate and blood pressure. It, thus, offers protection against stroke and coronary heart diseases.

              Furthermore, it contains a good amount of vitamin-B6 (pyridoxine), thiamin (vitamin B-1), vitamin-C, and manganese. Consumption of foods rich in vitamin-C helps the body develop resistance against infectious agents and scavenge harmful oxygen-free radicals. The human body uses manganese as a co-factor for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase.
